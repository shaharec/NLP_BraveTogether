Notorious short seller George Soros to trade Bitcoin!! Wreck this butthole,obizma,SatoshiStreetBets,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/obizma/notorious_short_seller_george_soros_to_trade/,"Everybody may have read the article about George Soros giving the green light to his hedgefund to trade bitcoin. Besides being the most sleezy mf‚Äôer to ever walk this earth, George is also a notorious short seller of assets and currencies. He was largely responsible for the collapse of the British Pound in 1992 by heavily shorting the currency and pocketing billions for himself.

If shit could shit, the result would still look better than this walking corpse and I really feel this guy needs a lesson in sharing. This overgrown piece of excrement is going to try to pull the same trick on bitcoin as he did with the pound. It‚Äôs already being reflected by todays price action.

Let‚Äôs take a stand against this leathery turd with eyeballs and fuck him over good. Let‚Äôs make him feel what it‚Äôs like to lose billions of dollars. Short sellers are premium assholes, and everything they touch turns to shit. 

Have faith in the future of bitcoin and do not let this butthole with a tongue expunge you out of your positions. Bitcoin is everything and crypto is the future Soros old dick & balls don‚Äôt have. 
It is time to accumulate, it‚Äôs time to BTFD, and show these billionaire buttmunchers it‚Äôs time for a wealthtransfer. They wrecked the world to where we stand now and it is time for a change!

In 2005, she helped form and worked with the Coalition Against Genocide in the United States to raise public awareness and protest the visit of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi to the U.S. as an honored guest. More about CAG & its eminent members can be read here:

https://www.ahouseofcards.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/a-house-of-cards-09-20-14_mrg2-Copy.pdf

One curious & significant point to note that CAG's effort to get Modi's visa banned was assisted primarily by evangelicals and Republicans (not Democrats or Muslims, even as the reason cited for his visa ban was Godhra riots), as those who worked for the lobbying themselves admit here:

https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/u-s-evangelicals-indian-expats-teamed-up-to-push-through-modi-visa-ban/?_r=1

Angana herself while in India worked at Jesuit org Indian Social Institute, which counts among its luminaries- Stan Swamy, Binayak Sen, etc. Jesuit university Georgetown (albeit its Saudi funded anti-Islamophobia research institute) is one of the biggest sponsors of Dismantling Hindutva Conference

CAG is an umbrella group of civil society grps, many of which were patronised by Angana herself. Eg She is one of the prominent members of **radical leftist org Forum of Inquilab Leftists (FOIL) created as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a clearing-house for radical Indian activists in the United States, Canada and England‚Ä¶ [to] help build projects that make [their] radical politics more material. Curious how while US itself bans communism, it allows radical Indian communists to operate from its soil.**

**Newsletter of FOIL is named Ghadar, after the overseas Ghadar party which tried to overthrow Brit rule in India. They aren't even subtle about their ""revolution"", are they?**

More on FOIL, here: https://www.ahouseofcards.net/groups/foil/

She is also associated with Friends of South Asia; Very briefly, described as a combination of FOIL and the Pakistan-American Association,with very apparent sponsorship from the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence, per the Pakistani media [5]. Led by Gera, Ra(h)man, Vinay Lal, Mainland Chinese CIIS graduate student(s) working for Chatterji , and several Pakistanis.

>**Sometime in April-May 2005, FOSA, which had received sponsorship from the Pakistan American Alliance (PAA), took out a public demonstration jointly in San Francisco. One of the ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù of that demonstration included a prominent placard that proclaimed ‚ÄúALLAH WILL DESTROY THE TERRORIST STATE OF INDIA.‚Äù**

>**When outrage ensued at this appalling, open call for the destruction of India, FOSA resorted to blatant cover-up by removing all references to PAA from its website. The complete account of FOSA‚Äôs chicanery in this connection is available in these documents:**

https://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/ideological-merchants-of-the-genocide-against-hindus-in-kashmir-the-symbolism-of-angana-chatterji

https://www.ahouseofcards.net/groups/fosa/

Both FOIL & ISI-linked FOSA alumni were behind the endevaor to erase India in California history books- replacing all references of India with ""ancient South Asia"" and replaced Hinduism with ""Ancient Indian religion"". This new edit also included many Hinduphobic propaganda characterising Hinduism as a religion replete with casteism & nothing else.

https://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/p7ox44/us_academicians_in_california_erased_india_in/

Again this endeavor to denigrate Hinduism was led by evangelicals groups like Dalit Freedom Network whose board members explicitly state: ‚ÄúThe worship of a hundred million gods will disappear. Idolatry will be cast down. But, what will replace it? There has never been a better soul-winning opportunity than right now in the nation of India‚Äù; who worked in collaboration with ""South Asian"" professors like Witzel.

https://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/p6cbsh/so_the_venerated_harvard_linguist_promoter_of_pie/

**Angana herself was also involved in lobbying for these Hinduphobc edits, where she had written a letter under FOSA‚Äôs banner to the California State Education Board expressing solidarity with FeTNA. Federation of Tamil Sangams in North America (FeTNA)  is a front of the now-defunct LTTE**

>**What‚Äôs interesting is that one fine morning, FeTNA‚Äôs ex-director Nachimuthu Socrates found himself in the arms of the FBI.** Here are some excerpts from the US Department of Justice regarding Nachimuthu:

‚Ä¶**NACHIMUTHU SOCRATES, a LTTE supporter in North America, and other defendants attempted and conspired to bribe purported U.S. State Department officials to remove the LTTE from the State Department‚Äôs Foreign Terrorist Organization list.** Beginning in 2004 and continuing over a period of several months, the defendants met with a confidential informant (CI-1), who was operating under law enforcement supervision, and two purported State Department officials, identified in the complaint as UC-1 and UC-2, and discussed the financial terms of the bribe, including a $1 million up-front payment.. During some of these meetings,‚Ä¶ **SOCRATES also discussed the sale of classified United States intelligence information to the LTTE. The complaint alleges that SOCRATES made interim bribery payments to the CI to give to UC-1.**

**The US government investigation also revealed that Nachimuthu & co were planning to procure surface-to-air missiles to use in their ‚Äúliberation war‚Äù against the Sri Lankan state. Angana Chatterji clearly has some charming associates.**

#*Funding by CIA front and her dedicated work against Hindu nationalism*

Some books and magazines by Angana: 

>Chatterji's publications include research monographs, reports and books. In 2004, she co-edited with Lubna Nazir Chaudhury a special issue of Cultural Dynamics, entitled ""Gendered Violence in South Asia: Nation and Community in The Postcolonial Present""[15] **In March 2009, after six and a half years of collaborative and theoretical research, she produced a study on Hindu nationalism entitled Violent Gods: Hindu Nationalism in India's Present; Narratives from Orissa, published by Three Essays Collective,[16] which received favourable reviews in popular periodicals,[17][18][19] and has been reviewed by American Ethnologist.[20]**

Clearly she has no love lost for Hindus.

>**She has co-contributed to an anthology with Tariq Ali, Arundhati Roy et al., Kashmir: The Case for Freedom (2011) and to South Asian Feminisms (2012), co-edited by Ania Loomba and Ritty A. Lukose.**[21] She is co-editor of Contesting Nation: Gendered Violence in South Asia; Notes on the Postcolonial Present (2013) and is working on a forthcoming title: Land and Justice: The Struggle for Cultural Survival.[22]

>**Chatterji serves on the board of directors of Vasundhara, and the advisory boards of the Kashmir Initiative at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University, Green Institute, Network of Indian Environmental Professionals, and World Prout Assembly.** . Chatterji has received support, including scholarships and research awards, for her work from various institutions, including  Ford Foundation, Wallace Global Foundation, **MacArthur Foundation, SwedForest, Marra Foundation, and the University of California, Berkeley.**

Globally acclaimed book on ColdWar ""Cultural Cold War"" eluciates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic & corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA's foreign policy objectives.

**The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA‚Äôs intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô**

**In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA‚Äôs penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.**

**‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.**

More can be read here:

https://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/op8nmj/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/

While Angana gets funded by Ford, she has written a book on Hindu nationalism in collaboration with a strategist employed by another of the CIA front foundations mentioned above- Carnegie Endowment.

From her website:

>In 2019, Chatterji co-edited, with Thomas Blom Hansen and Christophe Jaffrelot, the book Majoritarian State: How Hindu Nationalism is Changing India, in which contributors discussed how Hindu nationalism has influenced Indian government bodies and social sectors since 2014

https://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/pbck2p/one_name_which_everybody_is_glossing_over_in/

**What more, the tradition of Carnegie supplying CIA directors continues to this day!**

The chairperson of Carnegie's board of trustees is former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker,[6] and the organization's interim president is president is Thomas Carothers,[7] who replaced former Endowment president and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns[8] after Burns' nomination[9] and confirmation as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[10]

Within 2 years, in 2021, Jaffrelot is back with another book on Hindu nationalism (which he claims marginalises dalits & lower castes) and is one of the speakers at Dismantling Global Hindutva Conference cosponsored by 40+ centers at US universities.

**On a related note, here are 2 posts detailing how most of South Asia/India focused university centres in US were set up US intel personnel,including both at university of pennsylvia & Berkley, where Angana is employed.**

#*Testimony at United Nations Working Group Against India Wrt Human Rights in Kashmir & Demand for ""Self-Determination in Kashmir in collaboration with ISI agent Fai & Gautam Navlakha*

On July 25, 2010, Angana Chatterji along with Gautam Navlakha, Ved Bhasin, Ravinder Sachar (of Sachar Committee fame and prominent member of PUCL-confirmed by Chidambaram as UPA Home Minister on Rajya Sabha floor to be one of the 57 Maoist fronts in India per IB) signed ‚ÄúWashington Declaration‚Äù which sought the right ‚Äúof self determination‚Äù for Kashmiris- at a conference organised by Ghulam Nabi Fai.

https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-isi-vetted-indians-on-ghulam-nabi-fai-list-of-invitees-1576089

https://archive.is/FuPhU

Later Ghulam Fai would be convicted by FBI for illegal lobbying on behalf of Pakistan.

>**According to the 43-page FBI affidavit submitted to a US court, the ISI not only funded Fai's Kashmir American Council (KAC), which was run from its headquartered in Washington, but also dictated his speeches, determined who was to be invited to the conferences and even the results.**

Gautam Navlakha, journalist associated with CPDR, who openly espoused armed violence by Maoists, like here..

**Navlakha at event of CPDR (remember the name, this will come later): ""What have been Maoists been able to achieve peacefully? In Nepal, Maoists were elected on a mass scale & yet they were thwarted from coming to power. And yet you believe Maoists should give up armed revolution?Ridiculous! Indian Maoists should learn lesson from episode of Nepali Maoists & establish their military strength before anything..""**

https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g9lu9s/gautam_navlakha_on_importance_of_armed_communist/

..would go on to be named by FBI as ISI recruit. **US Attorney Neil H MacBride in an affidavit in 2011 on the basis of a FBI investigation that claimed the activist was introduced to an ISI General by Ghulam Nabi Fai for recruitment.Navlakha also pled to US for clemency for Fai. Also backed ""Kashmiri azadi""**

https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jbi0ev/nia_links_leftcongress_ecosystem_posterboy_gautam/

Angana Chatterji pled innocence of Fai's ISI links. **But the FBI charge sheet mentions a certain Mary who**

**-would be testifying in front of a United Nations working group. Mary is a human rights activist; Major General Mumtaz Ahmad Bajwa had requested that Fai introduce him to Mary in July 2009.** 

**Major General Bajwa was the head of ISI‚Äôs Security Directorate, which was responsible for nurturing and helping Kashmiri terrorist groups.**

**~~Mary~~ Angana is the only one of Fai's invitees who gave tetsimony in front of United Nations Working Group on Kashmir as her website proudly claims**

After Fai's role as ISI agent got exposed, again it would a Republican Congressman linked to the evangelical group Dalit Freedom Network, Trent Franks, who would come to her rescue to lend her authenticity certificate.

> In May 2007, Trent Franks introduced a resolution on untouchability as an unacceptable practice, a move aimed at furthering the cause of the Dalits. Except that this selfsame resolution was pasted verbatim on a website [now defunct] that talks about the prowess of Pakistan‚Äôs defence establishment! The reach of Congressman Trent Franks is as truly amazing as it is mysterious.

#Work with Soros, European Commission & European church funded HRLN

While Anagan's associated orgs FOSA & FOIL have worked multiple times with Soros funded Harsh Mander & Harsh Dobhal, Angana herself also has worked with them in India.

ISI linked FOSA's work with Harsh Dobhal of Combat Law & Soros funded Harsh Mander:

>After the outbreak of violence between the Hindu and Christian groups in December 2007, Chatterji testified to the Panigrahi Commission against the Sangh Parivar groups. **She wrote articles criticizing the Hindutva groups, when fresh religious violence broke out in Orissa after the murder of Swami Lakshmanananda  by missionary-Maoist nexus in August 2008. Looks like there was no criticism of murder of Swami by missionary-Maoists though**

>**The Indian People's Tribunal (IPT), also called the Indian People's Tribunal on Environmental and Human Rights or Independent People's Tribunal, was a People's Tribunal set up by the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) on 5 June 1993.**[1] The IPT is an unofficial body led by retired judges who form a panel that conducts public enquiries into human rights and environmental abuses. Among other things, IPT has practiced judicial activism against Sardar Sarovar Dam & Narmada project, bulldozing of slums in Mumbai, army in Kashmir,  Bandra Worli Sea Link Project, 
The SIPCOT chemical industry estate in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, proposed nuclear power plant and mines in Jaitapur.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_People%27s_Tribunal

In 2005, she co-convened a People's Tribunal to record testimonials on the experiences and concerns of different strata of people on the rise of the Hindu nationalist Sangh Parivar in Orissa. In this, Chatterji worked with Indian People's Tribunal on Environment and Human Rights, with Mihir Desai, Retired Chief Justice K.K. Usha of Kerala, Sudhir Pattnaik, Ram Puniyani, Colin Gonsalves and others. 

Some of the farce by her as part of this tribunal:

>Activists from the Sangh Parivar disrupted the hearing in Bhubaneswar.[citation needed] In a letter to the National Human Rights Commission of India, Chatterji said threats were faxed from the state office of the Vishva Hindu Parishad. The fax said the tribunal was a group of ""leftists, fellow travellers and Hindu baiters"". It went on ""The inclusion of an NRI[fn 1] well-known for anti-Hindu activities in the US suggests foreign funds from sources bent on destabilising the country"".[27] Chatterji alleged that Hindu nationalist activists threatened to rape tribunal members and to parade them naked in the streets.

>The tribunal conducted its investigation for almost twenty months and released its report in October 2006. It describes massive mobilisation of the Sangh Parivar, a Hindutva group, against Muslims and Christians, often justifying their actions on the basis of fabricated threats from the minorities. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had been promoting Hindu supremacy using force and coercion.[25] According to Dr. Chatterji, ""Forcible conversions to dominant Hinduism, social and economic boycotts, tonsuring, physical intimidation and violence, arson, and even murder are the weapons that Sangh Parivar cadre wields to intimidate and target disenfranchised groups and religious minorities such as Adivasis, Dalits, Christians, and Muslims"". 

Some notable people who have served on the tribunals:Siraj Mehfuz Daud, former Bombay HC judge; Mihir Desai, co-founder HRLN; Colin Gonsalves, co-founder HRLN & senior advocate at SC; V. R. Krishna Iyer, former SC judge; J. Kanakaraj, former judge of the high court of Madras' R. A. Mehta, former Gujarat HC judge; Sudhir Pattnaik, editor of the Oriya magazine Samadrushi; Padmanabhan Subramanian Poti, former Chief Justice of Kerala and Gujarat HCs,
**Rajinder Sachar (of Sachar committe fame & another Fai acquaintance of Angana);** P. B. Sawant, former SC judge; K. Sukumaran, former judge in Kerala and Bombay HCs; Hosbet Suresh, former judge of  Bombay HC; K. K. Usha, former chief justice of the high court of Kerala

**Who funds HRLN?**

European Commission; Christian Aid; Open Society Initiative (Soros); World Sikh Organisation (Khalistanis); Bread for the World (US Christian group); DKA Austria (Austrian Christian group); ""Foundation Open Society Inst."" (only Google match is FOSIP, a Pakistan based org); Miseroer (German Christian group); Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst (EED), Church‚Äôs Auxiliary for Social Action.

Snippet:

Boom‚Äìbust processes

Building on these ideas, I have developed a theory about boom‚Äìbust processes, or bubbles (Soros,¬†1987,¬†2008). Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend (see Figure¬†4). A boom‚Äìbust process is set in motion when a trend and a misconception positively reinforce each other. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, giving rise to climaxes which may or may not turn out to be genuine. If a trend is strong enough to survive the test, both the trend and the misconception will be further reinforced. Eventually, market expectations become so far removed from reality that people are forced to recognize that a misconception is involved. A twilight period ensues during which doubts grow and more people lose faith, but the prevailing trend is sustained by inertia. As Chuck Prince, former head of Citigroup said during the twilight of the super bubble: ‚ÄòAs long as the music is playing, you‚Äôve got to get up and dance. We‚Äôre still dancing.‚Äô Eventually, a point is reached when the trend is reversed, it then becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction. Boom‚Äìbust processes tend to be asymmetrical: booms are slow to develop and take a long time to become unsustainable, busts tend to be more abrupt, due to forced liquidation of unsustainable positions and the asymmetries introduced by leverage.",9/4/2021 5:11,0,,,,,

Yoda's political fanfiction: Rahul Gandhi vs George Soros(sequel) part 1,ou6q2m,librandu,https://www.reddit.com/r/librandu/comments/ou6q2m/yodas_political_fanfiction_rahul_gandhi_vs_george/,"Warning: Contains slightly graphic details(at the request of some of my fans of the [previous fanfiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/librandu/comments/maygov/yodas_political_fanfiction_rahul_gandhi_saves/)) and very naughty language

&#x200B;

It had been approximately 2 years since Rahul Gandhi's grand victory over the evil Maulana Modi who wanted to accomplish Ghazwa E Hind. Rahul Gandhi had transformed India into a Sharia Bolshevik society. A Sharia Bolshevik society with Rahul Gandhi characteristics.

These 2 years had been the most tumultuous for Rahul Gandhi with numerous assassination attempts on him and other strange occurances which caused quite some upheavel. One of those occurances was one in which around 100,000 very sexy looking Sadhguru lookalike minions roaming around the country turning everyone into stone with their sexiness. These lookalikes would eventually be stopped when Rahul Gandhi encountered them and in turn, turned them into stone with his own sexiness. No man sexier than Rahul Gandhi as the saying went in Rahul Gandhi's newest India.

Rahul Gandhi himself was engaged in a jihad. Anal love jihad. Love jihad is of course integral in Sharia Bolshevism. However, Rahul Gandhi was a very haram man with very haram desires. One of which involved anal sex. He was engaged in one of the most passionate forms of intense lovemaking with a handsome and hot Russian man named Ivan. Ivan had everything. Muscles, good looks, big height(which greatly fulfilled Rahul Gandhi's daddy kink) and great feet(which fulfilled Rahul Gandhi's foot fetish) amongst many things. In addition, he was awesome in bed. He knew many different kinds of satisfying sex positions and everytime Rahul Gandhi was engaged in anal love jihad with Ivan, he felt like he was going to heaven on a unicorn.

One particular anal love jihad session was different however. Rahul Gandhi and Ivan were engaged in a very passionate session which commenced with intense french kissing session followed by a wrestling session with even more french kissing which ended with a simple anal session. This time, however, Rahul Gandhi sat upright very soon before the wrestling session would begin. Ivan looked worried immediately. This wasn't like Rahul Gandhi. He also sat upright and looked straight at Rahul Gandhi's eyes before speaking.

Ivan: What's wrong my dear Rahul? This isn't like you to suddenly sit upright and disturb our great customary lovemaking session. Please do tell what's wrong comrade.

Rahul Gandhi looked deep into Ivan's eyes and sighed before speaking.

Rahul: O my sweet sweet Ivan I live in a state of panic constantly. These past 2 years have been nothing but a big test to see whether I would survive or die. Assassinations(both attempted and successful), bizzare upheavels and whatnot have plagued my India. I have lived through all these however I don't know how long I can continue like this. There is obviously a game being played by a grandmaster. A game which involves the ruination of India and I am a pawn in this game. I need to get to the bottom of this and do what is needed to protect my country from an adversary that threatens us from beyond the borders I feel. This has created a scenario in which I worry greatly and ponder about what I need to do to stay alive longer.

Upon finishing, Ivan had a knowing look in his eye. It was as if Ivan contained all the truth in the world in his mind and would impart upon him some great wisdom.

Ivan: Listen my love. You are one of the most dynamic, strongest and charming person I have ever met. Any challenge that comes in your way, you are quick to overcome it. You see ruling a country is hard and ruling a country like India is as hard as my trouser snake when I see you every morning I imagine. Whatever you go through, you will overcome it and I will be there to help you do so for there is no challenge too difficult for any of us comrade.

Rahul Gandhi was sniffing now. That was truly a very powerful statement that Ivan made.

Rahul: You... you think so?

Ivan: I would never lie to you my love

Rahul: Thank you my dear comrade

Rahul and Ivan embraced and it was a very passionate embrace. Immediately after, they restarted their love making session. Rahul and Ivan began wrestling intensely and while doing so screamed ""Sharia Bolshevism Zindabad"". After a while of doing so, they started the anal session. Rahul Gandhi was at the receiving end and repeatedly screamed ""Sharia Bolshevism ke dushmano ko"" and Ivan in turn screamed ""Goli maro saalo ko"". When it was time to climax, both screamed ""Sharia Bolshevism Zindabad!!!"". It was a noise heard throughout the entire parliament.

After the sex, Rahul and Ivan just lay in their beds and chilled. Rahul looked over at Ivan just to see that there was a slightly worried look on his face. He immediately inquired Ivan about this.

Rahul: What's wrong my love?

Ivan: Nothing. Nothing at all. I am just tired. We did have a very intense lovemaking session(more intense than all the others) and there was a lot of screaming. That ought to be tiring.

Rahul Gandhi wasn't entirely convinced of this explanation however he was also a bit tired and therefore, he didn't inquire Ivan further about this. Maybe Ivan is just tired. Little did Rahul Gandhi know that Ivan was an assassin who had been sent to kill Rahul Gandhi just a few months prior and he simply didn't have it in his heart to do so. Rahul Gandhi had never found out that the man with whom he felt madly in love with was the man who was tasked with Rahul Gandhi's undoing.

\~\~\~

It was a very relaxed evening in Islamabad and Imran Khan was watching his favourite TV show of all time: Ertugrul for probably the 400th time. He had already downed 3 glasses of lassi and had eaten 3 plates of biryani. Despite appearing to be content, Imran Khan had a deep fear in his heart and that fear would materialise as soon as he heard a knock on his door.

Imran Khan gulped. Answering the door would mean facing his worst nightmare and yet not answering the door would also be very bad. He took small footsteps with his feet trembling all the way and opened the door. There he saw the face that could terrify a thousand souls. George Soros.

Soros entered in and sat on the bed right next to the chair and the television. He had the look of malevolence mixed in with a certain sense of satisfaction. As if George Soros was about to do a great deed. It was a few moments of silence before Soros spoke.

Soros: So... you failed again

Imran Khan gulped even harder. This was going to end up very badly.

Imran: Sire... I try...try so hard bu..bu..but he just wouldn't die. You...you know I...I would never intentionally fail you...you and would do everything for you.

Imran Khan stammered and stuttered a lot. He had failed one too many times in trying to bring down George Soros' enemy number 1: Rahul Gandhi. He knew that there would be severe consequences for this but he had no idea what was in store for him.

Soros: If something repeatedly refuses to work properly, what do you do Imran?

Imran: You..you try to get it repaired

Soros: And if that doesn't work, what do you do?

Imran: You...you get rid of it I guess

Soros: That's right Imran. You rid yourself of that useless trash. What use is it to keep those things near to you when it becomes clear that they are not worth it anymore? I have tried many times to ""repair"" you Imran by advising you each and every single time to try harder each time in your endeavour. Each of your attempt ought to have been better than the last one but you failed to follow this simple instruction Imran. You failed me Imran.

Imran(crying now): I...I am so..so..sorry sire

Soros: Like hell you are

Without warning, George Soros' face enlarged until it had become extremely large. Following this, a snake like tongue escaped Soros' mouth and wrapped itself around Imran Khan. Imran Khan began to scream. Soros' tongue pushed Imran Khan towards his mouth and he promptly chomped down on Imran Khan. Imran was huge but so was Soros' face and the power of Soros' teeth and jaw was also very extraordinary. Within minutes, what remained of Imran Khan was a lot of blood on the floor.

Soros: Nothing that a vaccum cleaner mouth can't solve

Soros indeed used his mouth as a vaccum cleaner to vaccum all the blood in. This ought to hide evidence of Imran Khan's murder.

The very next day, Imran Khan's disappearance became a big talking matter both in India and Pakistan. For someone to just disappear like that without a trace is beyond weird. Rahul Gandhi looked at this news with shock and worry. Something big was going to happen and a lot is at stake here. Perhaps even the fate of India itself...

Forbidden Stories, Amnesty, Citizens's Labs & their respective fundings by Soros & Omidyar (who also fund Wire/Scroll. etc)

https://mobile.twitter.com/vijaygajera/status/1418574474119565313

First we come to Forbidden Stories. FS was launched by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom Voices Network. RSF the organisation behind primary index for deciding press freedom in each country is primarily funded by US,EU & Soros,Omidyar-(also funding AltNews/Wire). Accused of propaganda for US-led regime change in LatAm & Middle-East & whitewashing censorings by US-approved regimes. Last they were in news in India for speaking against FIR on Zubair Mohammed of AltNews for spreading fake news with intent to provoke communal tension- in the case where a Muslim was beaten by other Muslims & Zubair had claimed he was beaten because he refused to say Jai Shri Ram.

https://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/o3h8h0/how_the_world_press_freedom_index_was_politicized/

In the past, the RSF has funded media organisations that produce regime change propaganda against Syria and its president Bashar al-Assad. RSF itself receives funding from the US Government.

>Another donor of FS is Limelight Foundation (LF). The LF funds numerous organisations. One of the prominent among them is Bellingcat, a media initiative that produces propaganda that seeks to legitimize the West‚Äôs illegal war against Syria.

>Bellingcat has extensive ties to NATO, as reported by The Grayzone, and has cooperated with United Kingdom‚Äôs efforts to ‚Äúweaken Russia‚Äù. In addition, it also receives grants from the National Endowment for Democracy, which in turn is a US Government funded project.

>Omidyar channels its donations to FS via Luminate which is a bigger umbrella of NGO funding for furthering US strategic goals than even OSF of Soros. For example: Luminate donated to the Sundance Institute for producing films ‚Äúused strategically to articulate pressing public issues and movement-building campaigns.‚Äù The Grayzone report states, ‚ÄúAmong the films cited by Omidyar‚Äôs Luminate as a strategic success was The Last Men in Aleppo, an Oscar-nominated propaganda vehicle for the Syrian White Helmets that was produced by the Sundance Institute.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe White Helmets are a Syrian insurgent-aligned ‚Äúcivil rescue‚Äù group founded in Turkey by a British former military intelligence officer. Operating exclusively in rebel-held territory, including in the al Qaeda-controlled Idlib province, the White Helmets have been funded by USAID, the U.K. Foreign Office and the Qatari monarchy.‚Äù

https://www.opindia.com/2021/07/forbidden-stories-pegasus-links-us-regime-change-propaganda-luminate-george-soros-omidyar/


Furthermore, Luminate was run by Ben Scott, an Obama Administration official who has also worked in Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department. Speaking of Hilary & NGOs & Hilary's NGOs in civil war torn areas, this essay by Julian Assagne is a must read.

https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/

Omidyar also funds in India in Scroll, Caravan and the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN)

>FS also proudly displayed the endorsement by Mediapart‚Äôs Head of Investigations Fabrice Afri on its website until recently. Mediapart is the same leftist French organisation that has been peddling propaganda over the Rafale deal. 

Amnesty International

>Amnesty is known to have links to the British Government and was accused of having links to the Taliban. In 2020, Amnesty was forced to shut shop in India after its accounts were frozen by the Indian Government.

Amnesty again gets funds from Soros, Omidyar, Ford & Rockefeller foundations-last two confirmed to be functioning as foreign policy arms of CIA since cold war era.

*If you have time to read even a single link, I would urge you to read the link above. It eluciates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic & corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA's foreign policy objectives.*

In words of the most acclaimed book globally on ColdWar ""Cultural Cold War"":

>The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô

>**‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations,** which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.

>The system of private patronage was the pre-eminent model of how small, homogenous groups came to defend America‚Äôs ‚Äì and, by definition, their own ‚Äìinterests. Serving at the top of the pile was every self-respecting WASP‚Äôs ambition. The prize was a trusteeship on either the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation, both of which were conscious instruments of covert US foreign policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence.

Coming back  to third collaborator of Pegasus controversy:

>Citizens Lab is a project by the Canadian government. Citizen Lab is a research lab based in Munk School, which, is based in the University of Toronto. Open Society Foundation (George Soros), International Development Research Centre (government of Canada- same Canadian govt which is also backing Khalistanis- is heavily invested in IRDC and in turn, in Citizens Lab), HIVOS (This organization is intricately linked to George Soros‚Äô Open Society Foundation and receives funds from various international governments) and many more organisations were seen involved in Citizens Lab.

This thread by Vijay Patel encapsulates how Soros & Omidyar have their fingers in the pie of the ""truth to power"" Indian media.

>Scroll: it is registered in the USA. Gets Funds directly from Omidyar group and indirectly from Soros and Omidyar via another NGO MDIF. MDIF is funded by Soros and Omidyar network(Luminate) 

>MDIF also funds The News Minute and Boom Live in India. So they are getting indirect funds from Soros and Omidyar.This MDIF and OFS are banned in Russia for this type of funding to propaganda makers.

>Newslaundry: They have a direct investment of Omidyar group via their Mauritius branch ON Mauritius.Founder of Newslaundry Shekri was also Founder of NGO PCRF in which Kejriwal and Sisodia were also partners. 

>PCRF received its first fund by Kejariwals price money of Magsaysay Award. Magsaysay award is created and funded by the same Rockefeller brothers fund- as mentioned earlier foreign policy arm of CIA & also funds Amnesty. In 2005 and 2008 another NGO of Kejriwal and Sisodia 'Kabir' had received funds from Ford Foundation.In 1994 there was an NGO 'FDL-AP'. This NGO has one goal ' Free Kashmir' with some other Asian goals.This NGO was Funded by the same Soros. But the most shocking fact was that Sonia Gandhi was Co-President of this NGO

The HoloHOAX was made up by the CIA to denigrate National SOCIALIST German Worker's Party which was beloved by the german working class. In reality they only sent to camps dangerous Zionist terrorists who conspired against the party. The 6 million deaths number is absurd, there is no way they could have cremated that many in such a short period. The camps were designed for reeducation and had very good conditions, they even had zoos in there. The few deaths that did occur were the result of the Amerikkkan bombings of the supply lines

He lifted millions from poverty with his welfare programs and gave everyone a job. It's true that he didn't completely abolish private companies, but instead, he allowed them exist in order to develop productive forces while he planned to establish socialism by 1970. However, the companies that still existed lived in fear of the party and he even executed dissenting capitalists.

Most importantly he fought against western imperialism and he would have won if it weren't for the traitorous shitlib generals and zionist terrorists sabotaging him.

[link]^^1 

Your so stupid claiming the Palestinians didn‚Äôt control land, go research how many people have had their land stolen by settlers with the help of the Israeli army. How many Palestinians have land titles of land that is now under Israeli control?

Rachel Corrie died trying to prevent you scum bags from bulldozing innocent peoples homes, such vile humans to just run her over. 
Or just the other day the Israeli soldier unloaded a clip into a 13-year-old girl killing her and the military court found him not guilty. You people are disgusting.


Ok shill let‚Äôs go through the maps,

The 1st map is correct - 1917 there was NO Zionist state. So that the 1st picture is true.
Already your superiority complex makes you look stupid. 

1947 - 1949 the Nekba. No it‚Äôs not called a Nekba because they all left on their own. So after the Palestinians witnessed first hand the entire world sit back and didn‚Äôt do shit while they were being expelled to the tune of 700,000.

Go to the 4th picture is a close representation of the land divide today. 

Ottoman Empire, UN, League of Nations, have no authority to divide land they don‚Äôt own or control. Nor would the Ottoman Empire give away land to zionists.   

The preferred place to create a state of Israel before The Zionist organization in 1897 was Madagascar.

What Zionist propaganda shit are you trying to throw around here? You trying to fluff up the end result with bullshit in the middle. 

In every Zionist war against its neighbors they have continually stolen land. Golan Heights, part of Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan. 

There are no Zionist ancestors in Israel because it‚Äôs always been Palestinian lands. All of it!

Anyone who has done any research on the issue knows what I‚Äôm saying as fact. 
You Zionists are losing the entire information war because you refuse to admit anything. No it‚Äôs not all lies.

Like I told the other shills, 100 yrs to get to where you are today and in only 30 yrs of internet you can no longer keep a lid on the lies so you attack everyone as liars, hateful, or racists. That doesn‚Äôt work and only makes you look stupid. Go back to Israel and tell your handlers you need new updated material the shit your using doesn‚Äôt work  anymore. 

The question is, now that the cat is out of the bag, how long before the Zionist state is brought down?
There will be no Greater Israel, no rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. You can‚Äôt beat Hamas, you can‚Äôt beat Syria, you‚Äôre sure as fuck not beating Iran.

End apartheid Israel!

That is real revisionist history. It's happening right now, and you just contributed to it.

For fucks sake, Germany looked at their own state records, thought ""that was atrocious, what we did under Hitler,"" and banned the Holohoax belief. And the world also came to a consensus that Hitler and the Nazis were pieces of shit for doing everything they did.

People have known the Earth was a globe for centuries, and actual, real science was done to prove it. And the world cane to a consensus that the Earth was indeed roundish, and taught this is schools, and also went to space and the Moon and maybe also other planets like Mars later.

At what point did we stop laughing at the conspiracy theorists and put on tinfoil hats of our own? When did we start collectively thinking that ""the big guy"" is keepping a completely farfetched conspiracy out of our hands for no apparent reason?

How much of the original Mormon Temple Ceremony was taken from the free masons?,pdxw1p,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/pdxw1p/how_much_of_the_original_mormon_temple_ceremony/,"I thought there would be a bunch of ex-free mason material available online in the same way exmormons have posted a bunch of the Mormon Temple ceremony stuff online, but it's hard to find much.

Everything that's not masonry propaganda I find about masons is posted by religious organizations that don't like that masons force their members to say they don't need Jesus for salvation? Or something like that. Which I don't feel are super reliable sources.

But I found [this resource](http://www.ephesians5-11.org/handshakes.htm) that shows some of the masonic handsigns and the associated penalties with them. They look super similar to the Mormons' handsigns and they have penalties associated to revealing the handsigns in a similar way the Mormon temple did before the Mormons' took out the pantomiming of slitting your own throat and disemboweling yourself (iirc Mormons took it out sometime around 1990).

I'm super interested in learning about cults now and I'm just shocked that more people don't consider the Mormon church and free masonry cults.

My girfriend (Turkish) and I (French) flew from London to Lviv before flying to Turkey. 

We stayed a day and a half there but it definitely wasn‚Äôt enough as we fell in love with the city and will definitely be back. 

As we were walking through the city we could not stop but notice the amount of churches there are there. 

We both like churches/abbeys... and their architecture so we decided to go and visit a few. 

First of all we were astonished by the massive ceiling paintings and statues, and the gold everywhere. 

I could not help but notice a lot of All Seeing Eye in different forms and the Compass and Square. They were everywhere. Any reason why?

I know in France there are a very few but not as many as there are there.

 https://www.democracynow.org/2000/7/13/the_holocaust_industry

The Guardian newspaper in London calls it ‚Äúthe most controversial book of the year‚Äù. The Sunday Times labels it ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù. The Evening Standard says its author is a ‚Äúmaverick.‚Äù What do these newspapers have in common? They‚Äôre not American. [includes rush transcript]

The book is called The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering. It‚Äôs two pages in Britain‚Äôs Daily Mail and the Guardian is serializing it. It was number five on the bestseller list in Switzerland for two months. While it is burning up the British airwaves, it‚Äôs received almost no attention here in the US. In his book, political scientist Dr. Norman Finkelstein contends that what he calls the compensation industry has become an outright extortion racket.

Finkelstein has been called a Holocaust denier and has been the subject of major controversy and outrage in the compensation world. But he himself is the son of Holocaust survivors. Both of his parents were survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi concentration camps. His mother was at Majdanek and his father Auschwitz.",5/7/2018 21:38,,,,,,

You don‚Äôt understand how the holocaust industry works. It‚Äôs all about them being special and unique - just like their founding myths are about them being God‚Äôs most favouritest. They believe the holocaust entitled them to a freebie against the natives of Palestine. That‚Äôs literally how they think and when you buy into the holocaust industry you think like them too, it‚Äôs a Jewish supremacist psy-op. The holocaust is like the Beatles of historical narratives - it inspired strong emotions in its day, made its industry a lot of money, but today I something only boomers care about. I just wish they‚Äôd invent something newer and more entertaining to justify their monstrous Zionism and crimes against humanity. The movies in particular were all boring as fuck.

BEWARE OF LIES OF HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY 

 It's no anti-jewish its anti-robbery of Poland which those people on the postcard support.  To be more specific it's about ""restitution"" of heirless property of Jews who were POLISH CITIZENS who died during WWII which just like in any civilised country became property of the state based on dead persons citizenship. 

This is just another part of campaign of justification of chauvinists claims, just like former  secretary general of the World Jewish Congress  Israel Singer said :  ... ""*Poland and Poles will not be the  heirs of Polish Jews. We will never allow it (...) They will hear about  it from us as long as Poland exists. If Poland fails to fulfill Jewish  claims, it will be ""publicly attacked and humiliated"" on an  international forum.* ""

Gravity's Rainbow and the Holocaust Industry,5nbn7n,Canonade,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canonade/comments/5nbn7n/gravitys_rainbow_and_the_holocaust_industry/,"Is it just me, or is Pynchon really popular right now?

Anyway, I'm giving GR another whack, and I made it past page 100 this time.

This passage really stood out to me, because I don't hear it talked about a lot outside of some leftist circles (edit: I don't hear the *content* of the passage talked about): 

> The mass nature of wartime death is useful in many ways. It serves as spectacle, as diversion from the real movements of the War. It provides raw material to be recorded into History, so that children may be taught History as sequences of violence, battle after battle, and be more prepared for the adult world. Best of all, mass death's a stimulus to just ordinary folks, little fellows, to try 'n' grab a piece of that Pie while they're still here to gobble it up. The true war is a celebration of markets. Organic markets, carefully styled ""black"" by the professionals, spring up everywhere. Scrip, Sterling, Reichsmarks continue to move, severe as classical ballet, inside their antiseptic marble chambers. But out here, down here among the people, the truer currencies come into being. So, Jews are negotiable. Every bit as negotiable as cigarettes, cunt, or Hershey bars. Jews also carry an element of guilt, of future blackmail, which operates, natch, in favor of the professionals. 

Big fan of that passage. Anyway, I got the phrase 'holocaust industry' from Norman Finkelstein's book. No matter what you think of Finkelstein, I think you can agree that Pynchon is talking about (or hinting at) what Finkelstein was talking about, but I don't wanna get too political here. 

I think the point here is showing how the Allied decision makers knew full well that the holocaust was going on, and America's involvement in the war had absolutely nothing to do with stopping it; in fact the 'professionals' encouraged it for the promise of future blackmail. (The irony here, I would insert, is that the blackmail would come from Jews oppressing an ethnic population in Palestine.)

At least I think that's what Pynchon's saying.

---

Also to just kind of counter what could be called political hearsay in this post with something else, I'm just struck by the fluidity of the prose. I think Pynchon really is the cr√®me de la cr√®me when it comes to English prose. Maybe Joyce is a competitor, but I'm not familiar enough with his work to make that call. 

Are there any others? 

I would say Wallace, but compare a page of Infinite Jest to a page of Gravity's Rainbow and I personally think there's no contest (although Wallace does have the benefit of being complex without relying on prosaic devices like Pynchon does.) ",1/11/2017 13:18,,,,,,

Holocaust denials and professor Finkelstein,i9xlc3,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/i9xlc3/holocaust_denials_and_professor_finkelstein/,"Anti Zionist historian Norman Finkelstein, whose mother was a Holocaust survivor, had attended an off the record meeting (a secret meeting, really) of a group of antisemitisic members of the British Labour Party calling themselves ‚Äúthe committee against the witch-hunt‚Äù a name that‚Äôs referring to the a string of Labour members caught making blatantly antisemitic remarks about Jews and Israel. 

During the meeting Finkelstein was recorded saying that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt understand why Holocaust denial is such a big deal‚Äù He then proceeded to call British Holocaust denier David Irving a ‚Äúgreat historian who knew a thing or two or three...‚Äù 

That same Finkelstein wrote a book entitled ‚Äúthe Holocaust industry‚Äù where he claims Jews have exploited post war Germany in asking for reparations for people who‚Äôve survived the Holocaust. Not just by using that to shield Israel from criticism (as every Leftist and their mother says) but to make themselves rich. He also made a few bizarre remarks like calling Hezbollah ‚Äúfreedom fighters‚Äù and heroes and comparing them to the Anti Nazi resistance during world war 2. 

But recently he became a bit tempered, claiming that he‚Äôs opposed to BDS... But he didn‚Äôt change, and he won‚Äôt change. With this latest bizarre statement, Finkelstein proves yet again why he‚Äôs shunned by anyone in their right mind. 

After spending his entire career trying to persuade folks that the Israel lobby is trying to shut him off and ruin his career, by saying he thinks Holocaust denialism isn‚Äôt a big deal, and calling a Holocaust denier a ‚Äúhistorian‚Äù he proved that he deserved every bit of scorn he ever got.

The Nakba Industry,iwlncw,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/iwlncw/the_nakba_industry/,"Anti-Israel agitprop has a very peculiar relationship with facts and reality, it isn't exactly rare to see its proponents contradicting themselves in a single sentence, if you're looking for consistency you will be very disappointed. As it seeks to portray the Palestinian Arab cause as a major struggle for justice and human rights, the memory of the Holocaust poses an obvious obstacle, not to say a moral dilemma, anti-Israel attitudes towards the Jewish genocide therefore cover a wide spectrum ranging from outright denial to acknowledgement with a moral spin, from [expressing regret that Hitler didn't finish the job](https://i.imgur.com/CgtmWnT.jpg) (this fake quote attributed to Hitler reads *""I could have killed all the Jews in the world but left some of them alive so that the world might understand why I am killing them""*) to [highjacking Jewish suffering in order to portray Palestinian Arabs as Holocaust victims](https://i.imgur.com/VPfNgXQ.jpg) (implying that Israeli Jews are modern-day Nazis, or ""Zionazis"" in the anti-Israel lexicon), simply de-Judaising the Holocaust (claiming it wasn't just about the Jews) or complaining about the mighty ""Israel lobby"" whenever Israelis mention it, several of these attitudes coexist and every single one is a hallmark of anti-Israel agitprop.

There is only one stance where a case for consistency might be made, and that is the establishment of a false equivalence with the Nakba. Many anti-Israel propagandists insist on viewing the Jewish genocide and the Nakba as parallel events, the implication being that the former caused the latter (the Palestinian Arabs are now the real victims of the Holocaust according to this twisted narrative). This of course falls apart on closer inspection, after all the Palestinian cause's worst enemy is knowledge, a much closer parallel would be the 1923 population exchange between Turkey and Greece. Unbothered by factual discrepancies and thanks to the deafening absence of criticism towards this revisionist narrative, the Nakba has now achieved a status not too dissimilar to the Holocaust in current Palestinian mythology.

Originally a term used to describe the ""catastrophe"" of the Arab military defeat of 1948 (much like the term ""Naksah"" is used to describe the ""setback"" of the Six-Day War), since Arafat inaugurated Nakba day in 1998 a peculiar brand of Palestinian Arab victimhood culture has developed and continues to thrive. I like to call this phenomenon Nakbusiness, and though you might laugh at the name, it is quite a serious industry. Dozens of books, movies, TV series have been made on the Nakba, Ilan Pappe's *The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine* is now a secular Bible of sorts for those who subscribe to this victimhood culture, you can even buy [Nakba t-shirts](https://www.amazon.com/Palestine-Anti-War-Nakba-Protest-Palestinian/dp/B07D3Q7FWH?customId=B0752XJYNL&th=1), posters and Nakba-related music online (I'm sparing you an exhaustive list here). Nakbusiness is hands down one of the most successful phenomena in the world of politicised products, it ticks all the right boxes the ""woke"" intersectional customer is looking for.

20 years after Finkelstein's *The Holocaust Industry* was first published, yet another favourite of the anti-Israel crowd where he argued that Israel and its supporters were unfairly exploiting the memory of the Holocaust and by doing so corrupted Jewish culture, there are very legitimate grounds to ask those exact same questions as far as the Nakba Industry is of concern. Of course if Finkelstein had an ounce of integrity, he would've published *The Nakba Industry* by now, but that is too much to expect from him and his likes. Indeed, who would be foolish enough to deny that the memory of the Nakba has been invoked for narrow political interests and in order to win imaginary victories against Israel? Who is to say that this permanent victimhood culture hasn't yet harmed and corrupted Palestinian Arab culture, which has to be the culture of the oppressed and the culture of the ""steadfast"" at the same time? For the time being, it seems that the issues posed by Nakbusiness will be killed with silence, never to be addressed properly.",9/20/2020 23:33,,,,,,

Is the meat/dairy industry comparable to a holocaust?,p3xmm8,VeganForCircleJerkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganForCircleJerkers/comments/p3xmm8/is_the_meatdairy_industry_comparable_to_a/,"Obviously vegan btw

I‚Äôm not bringing this up to random people on the street, or people in a grocery store, or when just discussing why I‚Äôm not having dip at a party. When talking about veganism with more ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù leftists who aren‚Äôt vegan we often go in circles about the lack of ethical consumption under capitalism and other stereotypical talking points to excuse personal action.

Occasionally when talking about the meat/dairy industry & how we interact with it as a society I‚Äôll make comparisons to the pure technicalities of many previous holocausts in history. The act of the group ‚Äúin power‚Äù creating a rhetoric of the victims being lesser than and therefore ok to be used/killer. The fact that everyday people in that society often ignored it as an ugly reality.

I believe and explain that I‚Äôm never comparing the ‚Äúbadness‚Äù/suffering, or what is more right or wrong - just that the actual system (and how the public interacts with it) itself is very similar. People don‚Äôt like being compared to those who ignored the holocaust, or slavery at the time.

Is this going too far? When pointing out stuff like this, or the fact that animals are raped, people get emotive. I‚Äôve had people agree with me and also people call me the worst person in the world, or racist, anti-Semitic etc.

**The best arguments for major mainstream political positions:**

**Fascism and Neo-Conservatism** 

*On Dictatorship* and *The Concept of The Political* Carl Schmitt

Note:

>Some have argued that neoconservativism has been influenced by Schmitt Most notably the legal opinions offered by Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo et al. by invoking the unitary executive theory to justify highly controversial policies in the war on terror‚Äîsuch as introducing unlawful combatant status which purportedly would eliminate protection by the Geneva Conventions torture, NSA electronic surveillance program‚Äîmimic his writings.Professor David Luban said in 2011 that ""[a] Lexis search reveals five law review references to Schmitt between 1980 and 1990; 114 between 1990 and 2000; and 420 since 2000, with almost twice as many in the last five years as the previous five""

Crazy Christshitters spend years building up an incredibly detailed website to support their boomer ramblings,etyht3,Drama,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/etyht3/crazy_christshitters_spend_years_building_up_an/,"I present you http://www.fathersmanifesto.net/, a website of [The Christian Party](http://www.fathersmanifesto.net/christianparty.htm). BTW, **if you just want to read some drama/arguments go to the bottom of this post**.

What exactly is this website? Well, imagine a modern day Christian conspiraboomer, combined with a nazi zoomer, turn the insanity way up and rewind the time 20 years back. It contains a crazy number of pages documenting every single belief, and by belief I mean mostly conspiracy theories. One pretty special thing is excessive use of statistics and sources, often from the website's own polls, to support the arguments.

We have some classics here, such as [jews did 9/11](https://fathersmanifesto.net/wtc.htm). Of course, this has as separate [page with polls supporting the argument](https://fathersmanifesto.net/wtccalculations.htm).

Or [repeal the 19th amendment](https://fathersmanifesto.net/19th.htm). Again, with [proper sources of how 19th amendment contributed to US becoming a totalitarian state](https://fathersmanifesto.net/fedgov.htm). Please note how many links there are, and vast majority of them link to other pages exploring the issue in more depth.

There is an extensive criticism of [Roman Catholic Church](https://fathersmanifesto.net/rcc.htm), mostly related to pedos, gays, and, of course, jews. Scroll around 10% into the page to get to the text bullets expanding on most of these. Unsurprisingly, the website is [explicitly anti-bussy](https://fathersmanifesto.net/sodomy.htm), and the gayness is quite clearly a jewish construct. 

We can go a lot crazier from there. There are a lot of jewish ramblings, one of the best I found so far is [painting Einstein as a stupid plagiarist](https://fathersmanifesto.net/einstein.htm) who was anti white, stole his works and more. The logic of this page is flawless from the start

>""Ein stein"" means ""one stone"", a metaphor for half a brain

How can you even argue against that?

[Holocaust denial is a given](https://fathersmanifesto.net/holocaust.htm), but it gets better - the real Holocaust was actually committed against Christians üò±

>**The REAL holocaust**

>The historic growth rate of the Christian population of 1.5% per year means that the 682,400,000 Christians in the world in 1933 would have been 853,158,362 by 1948.  Instead, mostly due to W.W.II, the actual population was 592,406,542, a loss of 260,751,820 Christians.  Even at a more conservative growth rate of Christians of 1% per year, there were 199,838,673 fewer Christians in 1948 than there would have been without W.W.II.

>What about the worldwide population of jews?  Per  figures from FOUR different jewish sources: 1) The American Jewish Committee, Bureau of the Synagogue Council, 2) Judaica Encyclopedia, 3) The Standard Jewish Encyclopedia, and 4) The jews, their History, Culture, and Religion, it INCREASED by 584,549 jews between 1941 and 1948!

¬†
>Many White men have been harassed, fired, imprisoned, tortured, persecuted, prosecuted, and murdered for simply speaking the truths you will read in the following statistical analysis of the FACTS which are right at the fingertips of 295 million Americans and a billion Whites worldwide.   The REAL criminals, the ones who must now pay reparations to the WHITE men who simply spoke the truth, are the jews who used OUR own laws against our OWN people, simply to enrich themselves in a multi-billion holocaust industry of unfathomable proportions.   The jews must also pay reparations for the many Christians who died at the hands of jews like Dylan Klebold who killed in retribution for a holocaust that never was.

But the Christian holocaust didn't stop in WW2. It's still ongoing, and [it's the product of healthcare industry](https://fathersmanifesto.net/healthcare.htm). I recommend searching for word ""Australian"" and reading the bullets from there onwards, it's really good stuff, like:

Antisemitism Claims Mask a Reign of Political and Cultural Terror Across Europe - by Jonathan Cook - 16 Dec 2020,kejw85,BritishCommunist,https://www.reddit.com/r/BritishCommunist/comments/kejw85/antisemitism_claims_mask_a_reign_of_political_and/,"The Israeli newspaper Haaretz has run a fascinating long report this week offering a disturbing snapshot of the political climate rapidly emerging across Europe on the issue of antisemitism. The article documents a kind of cultural, political and intellectual reign of terror in Germany since the parliament passed a resolution last year equating support for non-violent boycotts of Israel with antisemitism.

The article concerns Germany but anyone reading it will see very strong parallels with what is happening in other European countries, especially the UK and France.

The same European leaders who a few years ago marched in Paris shouting ""Je suis Charlie"" ‚Äì upholding the inalienable free speech rights of white Europeans to offend Muslims by insulting and ridiculing their Prophet ‚Äì are now queuing up to outlaw free speech when it is directed against Israel, a state that refuses to end its belligerent occupation of Palestinian land. European leaders have repeatedly shown they are all too ready to crush the free speech of Palestinians, and those in solidarity with them, to avoid offending sections of the Jewish community.

The situation reduces to this: European Muslims have no right to take offence at insults about a religion they identify with, but European Jews have every right to take offence at criticism of an aggressive Middle Eastern state they identify with. Seen another way, the perverse secular priorities of European mainstream culture now place the sanctity of a militarised state, Israel, above the sanctity of a religion with a billion followers.

Guilt by association

This isn‚Äôt even a double standard. I can‚Äôt find a word in the dictionary that conveys the scale and degree of hypocrisy and bad faith involved.

If the American Jewish scholar Norman Finkelstein wrote a follow-up to his impassioned book The Holocaust Industry ‚Äì on the cynical use of the Holocaust to enrich and empower a Jewish organisational establishment at the expense of the Holocaust‚Äôs actual survivors ‚Äì he might be tempted to title it The Antisemitism Industry.

In the current climate in Europe, one that rejects any critical thinking in relation to broad areas of public life, that observation alone would enough to have one denounced as an antisemite. Which is why the Haaretz article ‚Äì far braver than anything you will read in a UK or US newspaper ‚Äì makes no bones about what is happening in Germany. It calls it a ""witch-hunt"". That is Haaretz‚Äôs way of saying that antisemitism has been politicised and weaponised ‚Äì a self-evident conclusion that will currently get you expelled from the British Labour party, even if you are Jewish.

The Haaretz story highlights two important developments in the way antisemitism has been, in the words of intellectuals and cultural leaders cited by the newspaper, ""instrumentalised"" in Germany.

Jewish organisations and their allies in Germany, as Haaretz reports, are openly weaponising antisemitism not only to damage the reputation of Israel‚Äôs harsher critics, but also to force out of the public and cultural domain ‚Äì through a kind of ""antisemitism guilt by association"" ‚Äì anyone who dares to entertain criticism of Israel.

Cultural associations, festivals, universities, Jewish research centres, political think-tanks, museums and libraries are being forced to scrutinise the past of those they wish to invite in case some minor transgression against Israel can be exploited by local Jewish organisations. That has created a toxic, politically paranoid atmosphere that inevitably kills trust and creativity.

But the psychosis runs deeper still. Israel, and anything related to it, has become such a combustible subject ‚Äì one that can ruin careers in an instant ‚Äì that most political, academic and cultural figures in Germany now choose to avoid it entirely. Israel, as its supporters intended, is rapidly becoming untouchable.

A case study noted by Haaretz is Peter Sch√§fer, a respected professor of ancient Judaism and Christianity studies who was forced to resign as director of Berlin‚Äôs Jewish Museum last year. Sch√§fer‚Äôs crime, in the eyes of Germany‚Äôs Jewish establishment, was that he staged an exhibition on Jerusalem that recognised the city‚Äôs three religious traditions, including a Muslim one.

He was immediately accused of promoting ""historical distortions"" and denounced as ""anti-Israel"". A reporter for Israel‚Äôs rightwing Jerusalem Post, which has been actively colluding with the Israeli government to smear critics of Israel, contacted Sch√§fer with a series of inciteful emails. The questions included ""Did you learn the wrong lesson from the Holocaust?"" and ""Israeli experts told me you disseminate antisemitism ‚Äì is that true?""

Sch√§fer observes:  ""The accusation of antisemitism is a club that allows one to deal a death blow, and political elements who have an interest in this are using it, without a doubt‚Ä¶ The museum staff gradually entered a state of panic. Then of course we also started to do background checks. Increasingly it poisoned the atmosphere and our work.""

Another prominent victim of these Jewish organisations tells Haaretz: ""Sometimes one thinks, ‚ÄòTo go to that conference?‚Äô ‚ÄòTo invite this colleague?‚Äô Afterward it means that for three weeks, I‚Äôll have to cope with a shitstorm, whereas I need the time for other things that I get paid for as a lecturer. There is a type of ‚Äòanticipatory obedience‚Äô or ‚Äòprior self-censorship.‚Äô""

Ringing off the hook

There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Germany. Jewish organisations are stirring up these ""shitstorms"" ‚Äì designed to paralyse political and cultural life for anyone who engages in even the mildest criticism of Israel ‚Äì at the highest levels of government. Don‚Äôt believe me? Here is Barack Obama explaining in his recent autobiography his efforts as US president to curb Israel‚Äôs expansion of its illegal settlements. Early on, he was warned to back off or face the wrath of the Israel lobby:

""Members of both parties worried about crossing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‚Äòanti-Israel‚Äô (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election.""

When Obama went ahead anyway in 2009 and proposed a modest freeze on Israel‚Äôs illegal settlements:

""The White House phones started ringing off the hook, as members of my national security team fielded calls from reporters, leaders of American Jewish organizations, prominent supporters, and members of Congress, all wondering why we were picking on Israel ‚Ä¶ this sort of pressure continued for much of 2009.""

He observes further:

""The noise orchestrated by Netanyahu had the intended effect of gobbling up our time, putting us on the defensive, and reminding me that normal policy differences with an Israeli prime minister ‚Äì even one who presided over a fragile coalition government ‚Äì exacted a political cost that didn‚Äôt exist when I dealt with the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, or any of our other closest allies.""

Doubtless, Obama dare not put down in writing his full thoughts about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu or the US lobbyists who worked on his behalf. But Obama‚Äôs remarks do show that, even a US president, supposedly the single most powerful person on the planet, ended up blanching in the face of this kind of relentless assault. For lesser mortals, the price is likely to be far graver.

No free speech on Israel

It was this same mobilisation of Jewish organisational pressure ‚Äì orchestrated, as Obama notes, by Israel and its partisans in the US and Europe ‚Äì that ended up dominating Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs five years as the leader of Britain‚Äôs leftwing Labour party, recasting a well-known anti-racism activist almost overnight as an antisemite.

It is the reason why his successor, Sir Keir Starmer, has outsourced part of Labour‚Äôs organisational oversight on Jewish and Israel-related matters to the very conservative Board of Deputies of British Jews, as given expression in Starmer‚Äôs signing up to the Board‚Äôs ""10 Pledges"".

PIC3

It is part of the reason why Starmer recently suspended Corbyn from the party, and then defied the membership‚Äôs demands that he be properly reinstated, after Corbyn expressed concerns about the way antisemitism allegations had been ""overstated for political reasons"" to damage him and Labour. (The rightwing Starmer, it should be noted, was also happy to use antisemitism as a pretext to eradicate the socialist agenda Corbyn had tried to revive in Labour.) It is why Starmer has imposed a blanket ban on constituency parties discussing Corbyn‚Äôs suspension. And it is why Labour‚Äôs shadow education secretary has joined the ruling Conservative party in threatening to strip universities of their funding if they allow free speech about Israel on campus.

Two types of Jews

But the Haaretz article raises another issue critical to understanding how Israel and the Jewish establishment in Europe are politicising antisemitism to protect Israel from criticism. The potential Achilles‚Äô heel of their campaign are Jewish dissidents, those who break with the supposed ""Jewish community"" line and create a space for others ‚Äì whether Palestinians or other non-Jews ‚Äì to criticise Israel. These Jewish dissenters risk serving as a reminder that trenchant criticism of Israel should not result in one being tarred an antisemite.

Israel and Jewish organisations, however, have made it their task to erode that idea by promoting a distinction ‚Äì an antisemitic one, at that ‚Äì between two types of Jews: good Jews (loyal to Israel), and bad Jews (disloyal to Israel).

Haaretz reports that officials in Germany, such as Felix Klein, the country‚Äôs antisemitism commissioner, and Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, are being allowed to define not only who is an antisemite, typically using support for Israel as the yardstick, but are also determining who are good Jews ‚Äì those politically like them ‚Äì and who are bad Jews ‚Äì those who disagree with them.

Despite Germany‚Äôs horrific recent history of Jew hatred, the German government, local authorities, the media, universities and cultural institutions have been encouraged by figures like Klein and Schuster to hound German Jews, even Israeli Jews living and working in Germany, from the country‚Äôs public and cultural space.

When, for example, a group of Israeli Jewish academics in Berlin held a series of online discussions about Zionism last year on the website of their art school, an Israeli reporter soon broke the story of a ""scandal"" involving boycott supporters receiving funding from the German government. Hours later the art school had pulled down the site, while the German education ministry issued a statement clarifying that it had provided no funding. The Israeli embassy officially declared the discussions held by these Israelis as ""antisemitic"", and a German foundation that documents antisemitism added the group to the list of antisemitic incidents it records.

Described as ‚Äòkapos‚Äô

So repressive has the cultural and political atmosphere grown in Germany that there has been a small backlash among cultural leaders. Some have dared to publish a letter protesting against the role of Klein, the antisemitism commissioner. Haaretz reports:

""The antisemitism czar, the letter charged, is working ‚Äòin synergy with the Israeli government‚Äô in an effort ‚Äòto discredit and silence opponents of Israel‚Äôs policies‚Äô and is abetting the ‚Äòinstrumentalization‚Äô that undermines the true struggle against antisemitism.

Figures like Klein have been so focused on tackling criticism of Israel from the left, including the Jewish left, that they have barely noted the ""acute danger Jews in Germany face due to the surge in far-right antisemitism"", the letter argues.

Again, the same picture can be seen across Europe. In the UK, the opposition Labour party, which should be a safe space for those leading the anti-racism struggle, is purging itself of Jews critical of Israel and using anti-semitism smears against prominent anti-racists, especially from other oppressed minorities.

Extraordinarily, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi, one of the founders of Jewish Voice for Labour, which supports Corbyn, recently found herself suspended by Starmer‚Äôs Labour. She had just appeared in a moving video in which she explained the ways antisemitism was being used by Jewish organisations to smear Jewish left-wingers like herself as ""traitors"" and ""kapos"" ‚Äì an incendiary term of abuse, as Wimborne-Idrissi points out, that refers to ""a Jewish inmate of a concentration camp who collaborated with the [Nazi] authorities, people who collaborated in the annihilation of their own people"".

In suspending her, Starmer effectively endorsed this campaign by the UK‚Äôs Jewish establishment of incitement against, and vilification of, leftwing Jews.

Earlier, Marc Wadsworth, a distinguished black anti-racism campaigner, found himself similarly suspended by Labour when he exposed the efforts of Ruth Smeeth, then a Labour MP and a former Jewish official in the Israel lobby group BICOM, to recruit the media to her campaign smearing political opponents on the left as antisemites.

In keeping with the rapid erosion of critical thinking in civil society organisations designed to uphold basic freedoms, Smeeth was recently appointed director of the prestigious free speech organisation Index on Censorship. There she can now work on suppressing criticism of Israel ‚Äì and attack ""bad Jews"" ‚Äì under cover of fighting censorship. In the new, inverted reality, censorship refers not to the smearing and silencing of a ""bad Jew"" like Wimborne-Idrissi, but to criticism of Israel over its human rights abuses, which supposedly ""censors"" the identification of ""good Jews"" with Israel ‚Äì now often seen as the crime of ""causing offence"".

Boy who cried wolf

The Haaretz article helps to contextualise Europe‚Äôs current antisemitism ""witch-hunt"", which targets anyone who criticises Israel or stands in solidarity with oppressed Palestinians, or associates with such people. It is an expansion of the earlier campaign by the Jewish establishment against ""the wrong kind of Jew"", as identified by Finkelstein in The Holocaust Industry. But this time Jewish organisations are playing a much higher-stakes, and more dangerous, political game.

Haaretz rightly fears that the Jewish leadership in Europe is not only silencing ordinary Jews but degrading the meaning ‚Äì the shock value ‚Äì of antisemitism through the very act of politicising it. Jewish organisations risk alienating the European left, which has historically stood with them against Jew hatred from the right. European anti-racists suddenly find themselves equated with, and smeared as, fledgling neo-Nazis.

If those who support human rights and demand an end to the oppression of Palestinians find themselves labelled antisemitic, it will become ever harder to distinguish between bogus (weaponised) ""antisemitism"" on the left and real Jew hatred from the right. The antisemitism smearers ‚Äì and their fellow travellers like Keir Starmer ‚Äì are likely to end up suffering their very own ""boy who cried wolf"" syndrome.

Or as Haaretz notes:

""The issue that is bothering the critics of the Bundestag [German parliament] resolution is whether the extension of the concept of antisemitism to encompass criticism of Israel is not actually adversely affecting the battle against antisemitism. The argument is that the ease with which the accusation is leveled could have the effect of eroding the concept itself.""

The Antisemitism Industry

It is worth noting the shared features of the new Antisemitism Industry and Finkelstein‚Äôs earlier discussions of the Holocaust Industry.

In his book, Finkelstein identifies the ""wrong Jews"" as people like his mother, who survived a Nazi death camp as the rest of her family perished. These surviving Jews, Finkelstein argues, were valued by the Holocaust Industry only in so far as they served as a promotional tool for the Jewish establishment to accumulate more wealth and cultural and political status. Otherwise, the victims were ignored because the actual Holocaust‚Äôs message ‚Äì in contrast to the Jewish leadership‚Äôs representation of it ‚Äì was universal: that we must oppose and fight all forms of racism because they lead to persecution and genocide.

Instead the Holocaust Industry promoted a particularist, self-interested lesson that the Holocaust proves Jews are uniquely oppressed and that they therefore deserve a unique solution: a state, Israel, that must be given unique leeway by western states to commit crimes in violation of international law. The Holocaust Industry ‚Äì very much to be distinguished from the real events of the Holocaust ‚Äì is deeply entwined in, and rationalised by, the perpetuation of the racialist, colonial project of Israel.

In the case of the Antisemitism Industry, the ""wrong Jew"" surfaces again. This time the witch-hunt targets Jewish leftwingers, Jews critical of Israel, Jews opposed to the occupation, and Jews who support a boycott of the illegal settlements or of Israel itself. Again, the problem with these ""bad Jews"" is that they allude to a universal lesson, one that says Palestinians have at least as much right to self-determination, to dignity and security, in their historic homeland as Jewish immigrants who fled European persecution.

In contrast to the ""bad Jews"", the Antisemitism Industry demands that a particularist conclusion be drawn about Israel ‚Äì just as a particularist conclusion was earlier drawn by the Holocaust Industry. It says that to deny Jews a state is to leave them defenceless against the eternal virus of antisemitism. In this conception, the Holocaust may be uniquely abhorrent but it is far from unique. Non-Jews, given the right circumstances, are only too capable of carrying out another Holocaust. Jews must therefore always be protected, always on guard, always have their weapons (or in Israel‚Äôs case, its nuclear bombs) to hand.

‚ÄòGet out of jail‚Äô card

This view, of course, seeks to ignore, or marginalise, other victims of the Holocaust ‚Äì Romanies, communists, gays ‚Äì and other kinds of racism. It needs to create a hierarchy of racisms, a competition between them, in which hatred of Jews is at the pinnacle. This is how we arrived at an absurdity: that anti-Zionism ‚Äì misrepresented as the rejection of a refuge for Jews, rather than the reality that it rejects an ethnic, colonial state oppressing Palestinians ‚Äì is the same as antisemitism.

Extraordinarily, as the Haaretz article clarifies, German officials are oppressing ""bad Jews"", at the instigation of Jewish organisations, to prevent, as they see it, the re-emergence of the far-right and neo-Nazis. The criticisms of Israel made by the ""bad Jew"" are thereby not just dismissed as ideologically unsound or delusions but become proof that these Jews are colluding with, or at least nourishing, the Jew haters.

In this way, Germany, the UK and much of Europe have come to justify the exclusion of the ""wrong Jew"" ‚Äì those who uphold universal principles for the benefit of all ‚Äì from the public space. Which, of course, is exactly what Israel wants, because, rooted as it is in an ideology of ethnic exclusivity as a ""Jewish state"", it necessarily rejects universal ethics.

What we see here is an illustration of a principle at the heart of Israel‚Äôs state ideology of Zionism: Israel needs antisemitism. Israel would quite literally have to invent antisemitism if it did not exist.

This is not hyperbole. The idea that the ""virus of antisemitism"" lies semi-dormant in every non-Jew waiting for a chance to overwhelm its host is the essential rationale for Israel. If the Holocaust was an exceptional historical event, if antisemitism was an ancient racism that in its modern incarnation followed the patterns of prejudice and hatred familiar in all racisms, from anti-black bigotry to Islamophobia, Israel would be not only redundant but an abomination ‚Äì because it has been set up to dispossess and abuse another group, the Palestinians.

Antisemitism is Israel‚Äôs ""get out of jail"" card. Antisemitism serves to absolve Israel of the racism it structurally embodies and that would be impossible to overlook were Israel deprived of the misdirection weaponised antisemitism provides.

An empty space

The Haaretz article provides a genuine service by not only reminding us that ""bad Jews"" exist but in coming to their defence ‚Äì something that European media is no longer willing to do. To defend ""bad Jews"" like Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi is to be contaminated with the same taint of antisemitism that justified the ejection of these Jews from the public space.

Haaretz records the effort of a few brave cultural institutions in Germany to protest, to hold the line, against this new McCarthyism. Their stand may fail. If it does, you may never become aware of it.

Once, the ""bad Jews"" have been smeared into silence, as Palestinians and those who stand in solidarity with them largely have been already; when social media has de-platformed critics of Israel as Jew haters; when the media and political parties enforce this silence so absolutely they no longer need to smear anyone as an antisemite because these ""antisemites"" have been disappeared; when the Jewish ""community"" speaks with one voice because its other voices have been eliminated; when the censorship is complete, you will not know it.

There will be no record of what was lost. There will be simply an empty space, a blank slate, where discussions of Israel‚Äôs crimes against Palestinians once existed. What you will hear instead is only what Israel and its partisans want you to hear. Your ignorance will be blissfully complete.

Antisemitism Claims Mask a Reign of Political and Cultural Terror Across Europe - by Jonathan Cook - 16 Dec 2020,kejwyh,leftwinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/leftwinger/comments/kejwyh/antisemitism_claims_mask_a_reign_of_political_and/,"The Israeli newspaper Haaretz has run a fascinating long report this week offering a disturbing snapshot of the political climate rapidly emerging across Europe on the issue of antisemitism. The article documents a kind of cultural, political and intellectual reign of terror in Germany since the parliament passed a resolution last year equating support for non-violent boycotts of Israel with antisemitism.

The article concerns Germany but anyone reading it will see very strong parallels with what is happening in other European countries, especially the UK and France.

The same European leaders who a few years ago marched in Paris shouting ""Je suis Charlie"" ‚Äì upholding the inalienable free speech rights of white Europeans to offend Muslims by insulting and ridiculing their Prophet ‚Äì are now queuing up to outlaw free speech when it is directed against Israel, a state that refuses to end its belligerent occupation of Palestinian land. European leaders have repeatedly shown they are all too ready to crush the free speech of Palestinians, and those in solidarity with them, to avoid offending sections of the Jewish community.

The situation reduces to this: European Muslims have no right to take offence at insults about a religion they identify with, but European Jews have every right to take offence at criticism of an aggressive Middle Eastern state they identify with. Seen another way, the perverse secular priorities of European mainstream culture now place the sanctity of a militarised state, Israel, above the sanctity of a religion with a billion followers.

Guilt by association

This isn‚Äôt even a double standard. I can‚Äôt find a word in the dictionary that conveys the scale and degree of hypocrisy and bad faith involved.

If the American Jewish scholar Norman Finkelstein wrote a follow-up to his impassioned book The Holocaust Industry ‚Äì on the cynical use of the Holocaust to enrich and empower a Jewish organisational establishment at the expense of the Holocaust‚Äôs actual survivors ‚Äì he might be tempted to title it The Antisemitism Industry.

In the current climate in Europe, one that rejects any critical thinking in relation to broad areas of public life, that observation alone would enough to have one denounced as an antisemite. Which is why the Haaretz article ‚Äì far braver than anything you will read in a UK or US newspaper ‚Äì makes no bones about what is happening in Germany. It calls it a ""witch-hunt"". That is Haaretz‚Äôs way of saying that antisemitism has been politicised and weaponised ‚Äì a self-evident conclusion that will currently get you expelled from the British Labour party, even if you are Jewish.

The Haaretz story highlights two important developments in the way antisemitism has been, in the words of intellectuals and cultural leaders cited by the newspaper, ""instrumentalised"" in Germany.

Jewish organisations and their allies in Germany, as Haaretz reports, are openly weaponising antisemitism not only to damage the reputation of Israel‚Äôs harsher critics, but also to force out of the public and cultural domain ‚Äì through a kind of ""antisemitism guilt by association"" ‚Äì anyone who dares to entertain criticism of Israel.

Cultural associations, festivals, universities, Jewish research centres, political think-tanks, museums and libraries are being forced to scrutinise the past of those they wish to invite in case some minor transgression against Israel can be exploited by local Jewish organisations. That has created a toxic, politically paranoid atmosphere that inevitably kills trust and creativity.

But the psychosis runs deeper still. Israel, and anything related to it, has become such a combustible subject ‚Äì one that can ruin careers in an instant ‚Äì that most political, academic and cultural figures in Germany now choose to avoid it entirely. Israel, as its supporters intended, is rapidly becoming untouchable.

A case study noted by Haaretz is Peter Sch√§fer, a respected professor of ancient Judaism and Christianity studies who was forced to resign as director of Berlin‚Äôs Jewish Museum last year. Sch√§fer‚Äôs crime, in the eyes of Germany‚Äôs Jewish establishment, was that he staged an exhibition on Jerusalem that recognised the city‚Äôs three religious traditions, including a Muslim one.

He was immediately accused of promoting ""historical distortions"" and denounced as ""anti-Israel"". A reporter for Israel‚Äôs rightwing Jerusalem Post, which has been actively colluding with the Israeli government to smear critics of Israel, contacted Sch√§fer with a series of inciteful emails. The questions included ""Did you learn the wrong lesson from the Holocaust?"" and ""Israeli experts told me you disseminate antisemitism ‚Äì is that true?""

Sch√§fer observes: ""The accusation of antisemitism is a club that allows one to deal a death blow, and political elements who have an interest in this are using it, without a doubt‚Ä¶ The museum staff gradually entered a state of panic. Then of course we also started to do background checks. Increasingly it poisoned the atmosphere and our work.""

Another prominent victim of these Jewish organisations tells Haaretz: ""Sometimes one thinks, ‚ÄòTo go to that conference?‚Äô ‚ÄòTo invite this colleague?‚Äô Afterward it means that for three weeks, I‚Äôll have to cope with a shitstorm, whereas I need the time for other things that I get paid for as a lecturer. There is a type of ‚Äòanticipatory obedience‚Äô or ‚Äòprior self-censorship.‚Äô""

Ringing off the hook

There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Germany. Jewish organisations are stirring up these ""shitstorms"" ‚Äì designed to paralyse political and cultural life for anyone who engages in even the mildest criticism of Israel ‚Äì at the highest levels of government. Don‚Äôt believe me? Here is Barack Obama explaining in his recent autobiography his efforts as US president to curb Israel‚Äôs expansion of its illegal settlements. Early on, he was warned to back off or face the wrath of the Israel lobby:

""Members of both parties worried about crossing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‚Äòanti-Israel‚Äô (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election.""

When Obama went ahead anyway in 2009 and proposed a modest freeze on Israel‚Äôs illegal settlements:

""The White House phones started ringing off the hook, as members of my national security team fielded calls from reporters, leaders of American Jewish organizations, prominent supporters, and members of Congress, all wondering why we were picking on Israel ‚Ä¶ this sort of pressure continued for much of 2009.""

He observes further:

""The noise orchestrated by Netanyahu had the intended effect of gobbling up our time, putting us on the defensive, and reminding me that normal policy differences with an Israeli prime minister ‚Äì even one who presided over a fragile coalition government ‚Äì exacted a political cost that didn‚Äôt exist when I dealt with the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, or any of our other closest allies.""

Doubtless, Obama dare not put down in writing his full thoughts about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu or the US lobbyists who worked on his behalf. But Obama‚Äôs remarks do show that, even a US president, supposedly the single most powerful person on the planet, ended up blanching in the face of this kind of relentless assault. For lesser mortals, the price is likely to be far graver.

No free speech on Israel

It was this same mobilisation of Jewish organisational pressure ‚Äì orchestrated, as Obama notes, by Israel and its partisans in the US and Europe ‚Äì that ended up dominating Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs five years as the leader of Britain‚Äôs leftwing Labour party, recasting a well-known anti-racism activist almost overnight as an antisemite.

It is the reason why his successor, Sir Keir Starmer, has outsourced part of Labour‚Äôs organisational oversight on Jewish and Israel-related matters to the very conservative Board of Deputies of British Jews, as given expression in Starmer‚Äôs signing up to the Board‚Äôs ""10 Pledges"".

PIC3

It is part of the reason why Starmer recently suspended Corbyn from the party, and then defied the membership‚Äôs demands that he be properly reinstated, after Corbyn expressed concerns about the way antisemitism allegations had been ""overstated for political reasons"" to damage him and Labour. (The rightwing Starmer, it should be noted, was also happy to use antisemitism as a pretext to eradicate the socialist agenda Corbyn had tried to revive in Labour.) It is why Starmer has imposed a blanket ban on constituency parties discussing Corbyn‚Äôs suspension. And it is why Labour‚Äôs shadow education secretary has joined the ruling Conservative party in threatening to strip universities of their funding if they allow free speech about Israel on campus.

Two types of Jews

But the Haaretz article raises another issue critical to understanding how Israel and the Jewish establishment in Europe are politicising antisemitism to protect Israel from criticism. The potential Achilles‚Äô heel of their campaign are Jewish dissidents, those who break with the supposed ""Jewish community"" line and create a space for others ‚Äì whether Palestinians or other non-Jews ‚Äì to criticise Israel. These Jewish dissenters risk serving as a reminder that trenchant criticism of Israel should not result in one being tarred an antisemite.

Israel and Jewish organisations, however, have made it their task to erode that idea by promoting a distinction ‚Äì an antisemitic one, at that ‚Äì between two types of Jews: good Jews (loyal to Israel), and bad Jews (disloyal to Israel).

Haaretz reports that officials in Germany, such as Felix Klein, the country‚Äôs antisemitism commissioner, and Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, are being allowed to define not only who is an antisemite, typically using support for Israel as the yardstick, but are also determining who are good Jews ‚Äì those politically like them ‚Äì and who are bad Jews ‚Äì those who disagree with them.

Despite Germany‚Äôs horrific recent history of Jew hatred, the German government, local authorities, the media, universities and cultural institutions have been encouraged by figures like Klein and Schuster to hound German Jews, even Israeli Jews living and working in Germany, from the country‚Äôs public and cultural space.

When, for example, a group of Israeli Jewish academics in Berlin held a series of online discussions about Zionism last year on the website of their art school, an Israeli reporter soon broke the story of a ""scandal"" involving boycott supporters receiving funding from the German government. Hours later the art school had pulled down the site, while the German education ministry issued a statement clarifying that it had provided no funding. The Israeli embassy officially declared the discussions held by these Israelis as ""antisemitic"", and a German foundation that documents antisemitism added the group to the list of antisemitic incidents it records.

Described as ‚Äòkapos‚Äô

So repressive has the cultural and political atmosphere grown in Germany that there has been a small backlash among cultural leaders. Some have dared to publish a letter protesting against the role of Klein, the antisemitism commissioner. Haaretz reports:

""The antisemitism czar, the letter charged, is working ‚Äòin synergy with the Israeli government‚Äô in an effort ‚Äòto discredit and silence opponents of Israel‚Äôs policies‚Äô and is abetting the ‚Äòinstrumentalization‚Äô that undermines the true struggle against antisemitism.

Figures like Klein have been so focused on tackling criticism of Israel from the left, including the Jewish left, that they have barely noted the ""acute danger Jews in Germany face due to the surge in far-right antisemitism"", the letter argues.

Again, the same picture can be seen across Europe. In the UK, the opposition Labour party, which should be a safe space for those leading the anti-racism struggle, is purging itself of Jews critical of Israel and using anti-semitism smears against prominent anti-racists, especially from other oppressed minorities.

Extraordinarily, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi, one of the founders of Jewish Voice for Labour, which supports Corbyn, recently found herself suspended by Starmer‚Äôs Labour. She had just appeared in a moving video in which she explained the ways antisemitism was being used by Jewish organisations to smear Jewish left-wingers like herself as ""traitors"" and ""kapos"" ‚Äì an incendiary term of abuse, as Wimborne-Idrissi points out, that refers to ""a Jewish inmate of a concentration camp who collaborated with the [Nazi] authorities, people who collaborated in the annihilation of their own people"".

In suspending her, Starmer effectively endorsed this campaign by the UK‚Äôs Jewish establishment of incitement against, and vilification of, leftwing Jews.

Earlier, Marc Wadsworth, a distinguished black anti-racism campaigner, found himself similarly suspended by Labour when he exposed the efforts of Ruth Smeeth, then a Labour MP and a former Jewish official in the Israel lobby group BICOM, to recruit the media to her campaign smearing political opponents on the left as antisemites.

In keeping with the rapid erosion of critical thinking in civil society organisations designed to uphold basic freedoms, Smeeth was recently appointed director of the prestigious free speech organisation Index on Censorship. There she can now work on suppressing criticism of Israel ‚Äì and attack ""bad Jews"" ‚Äì under cover of fighting censorship. In the new, inverted reality, censorship refers not to the smearing and silencing of a ""bad Jew"" like Wimborne-Idrissi, but to criticism of Israel over its human rights abuses, which supposedly ""censors"" the identification of ""good Jews"" with Israel ‚Äì now often seen as the crime of ""causing offence"".

Boy who cried wolf

The Haaretz article helps to contextualise Europe‚Äôs current antisemitism ""witch-hunt"", which targets anyone who criticises Israel or stands in solidarity with oppressed Palestinians, or associates with such people. It is an expansion of the earlier campaign by the Jewish establishment against ""the wrong kind of Jew"", as identified by Finkelstein in The Holocaust Industry. But this time Jewish organisations are playing a much higher-stakes, and more dangerous, political game.

Haaretz rightly fears that the Jewish leadership in Europe is not only silencing ordinary Jews but degrading the meaning ‚Äì the shock value ‚Äì of antisemitism through the very act of politicising it. Jewish organisations risk alienating the European left, which has historically stood with them against Jew hatred from the right. European anti-racists suddenly find themselves equated with, and smeared as, fledgling neo-Nazis.

If those who support human rights and demand an end to the oppression of Palestinians find themselves labelled antisemitic, it will become ever harder to distinguish between bogus (weaponised) ""antisemitism"" on the left and real Jew hatred from the right. The antisemitism smearers ‚Äì and their fellow travellers like Keir Starmer ‚Äì are likely to end up suffering their very own ""boy who cried wolf"" syndrome.

Or as Haaretz notes:

""The issue that is bothering the critics of the Bundestag [German parliament] resolution is whether the extension of the concept of antisemitism to encompass criticism of Israel is not actually adversely affecting the battle against antisemitism. The argument is that the ease with which the accusation is leveled could have the effect of eroding the concept itself.""

The Antisemitism Industry

It is worth noting the shared features of the new Antisemitism Industry and Finkelstein‚Äôs earlier discussions of the Holocaust Industry.

In his book, Finkelstein identifies the ""wrong Jews"" as people like his mother, who survived a Nazi death camp as the rest of her family perished. These surviving Jews, Finkelstein argues, were valued by the Holocaust Industry only in so far as they served as a promotional tool for the Jewish establishment to accumulate more wealth and cultural and political status. Otherwise, the victims were ignored because the actual Holocaust‚Äôs message ‚Äì in contrast to the Jewish leadership‚Äôs representation of it ‚Äì was universal: that we must oppose and fight all forms of racism because they lead to persecution and genocide.

Instead the Holocaust Industry promoted a particularist, self-interested lesson that the Holocaust proves Jews are uniquely oppressed and that they therefore deserve a unique solution: a state, Israel, that must be given unique leeway by western states to commit crimes in violation of international law. The Holocaust Industry ‚Äì very much to be distinguished from the real events of the Holocaust ‚Äì is deeply entwined in, and rationalised by, the perpetuation of the racialist, colonial project of Israel.

In the case of the Antisemitism Industry, the ""wrong Jew"" surfaces again. This time the witch-hunt targets Jewish leftwingers, Jews critical of Israel, Jews opposed to the occupation, and Jews who support a boycott of the illegal settlements or of Israel itself. Again, the problem with these ""bad Jews"" is that they allude to a universal lesson, one that says Palestinians have at least as much right to self-determination, to dignity and security, in their historic homeland as Jewish immigrants who fled European persecution.

In contrast to the ""bad Jews"", the Antisemitism Industry demands that a particularist conclusion be drawn about Israel ‚Äì just as a particularist conclusion was earlier drawn by the Holocaust Industry. It says that to deny Jews a state is to leave them defenceless against the eternal virus of antisemitism. In this conception, the Holocaust may be uniquely abhorrent but it is far from unique. Non-Jews, given the right circumstances, are only too capable of carrying out another Holocaust. Jews must therefore always be protected, always on guard, always have their weapons (or in Israel‚Äôs case, its nuclear bombs) to hand.

‚ÄòGet out of jail‚Äô card

This view, of course, seeks to ignore, or marginalise, other victims of the Holocaust ‚Äì Romanies, communists, gays ‚Äì and other kinds of racism. It needs to create a hierarchy of racisms, a competition between them, in which hatred of Jews is at the pinnacle. This is how we arrived at an absurdity: that anti-Zionism ‚Äì misrepresented as the rejection of a refuge for Jews, rather than the reality that it rejects an ethnic, colonial state oppressing Palestinians ‚Äì is the same as antisemitism.

The criticisms of Israel made by the ""bad Jew"" are thereby not just dismissed as ideologically unsound or delusions but become proof that these Jews are colluding with, or at least nourishing, the Jew haters.

In this way, Germany, the UK and much of Europe have come to justify the exclusion of the ""wrong Jew"" ‚Äì those who uphold universal principles for the benefit of all ‚Äì from the public space. Which, of course, is exactly what Israel wants, because, rooted as it is in an ideology of ethnic exclusivity as a ""Jewish state"", it necessarily rejects universal ethics.

Antisemitism is Israel‚Äôs ""get out of jail"" card. Antisemitism serves to absolve Israel of the racism it structurally embodies and that would be impossible to overlook were Israel deprived of the misdirection weaponised antisemitism provides.

Antisemitism Claims Mask a Reign of Political and Cultural Terror Across Europe - by Jonathan Cook - 16 Dec 2020,kejxef,Socialist_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialist_/comments/kejxef/antisemitism_claims_mask_a_reign_of_political_and/,"The Israeli newspaper Haaretz has run a fascinating long report this week offering a disturbing snapshot of the political climate rapidly emerging across Europe on the issue of antisemitism. The article documents a kind of cultural, political and intellectual reign of terror in Germany since the parliament passed a resolution last year equating support for non-violent boycotts of Israel with antisemitism.

The article concerns Germany but anyone reading it will see very strong parallels with what is happening in other European countries, especially the UK and France.

The same European leaders who a few years ago marched in Paris shouting ""Je suis Charlie"" ‚Äì upholding the inalienable free speech rights of white Europeans to offend Muslims by insulting and ridiculing their Prophet ‚Äì are now queuing up to outlaw free speech when it is directed against Israel, a state that refuses to end its belligerent occupation of Palestinian land.

Guilt by association

This isn‚Äôt even a double standard. I can‚Äôt find a word in the dictionary that conveys the scale and degree of hypocrisy and bad faith involved.

If the American Jewish scholar Norman Finkelstein wrote a follow-up to his impassioned book The Holocaust Industry ‚Äì on the cynical use of the Holocaust to enrich and empower a Jewish organisational establishment at the expense of the Holocaust‚Äôs actual survivors ‚Äì he might be tempted to title it The Antisemitism Industry.

In the current climate in Europe, one that rejects any critical thinking in relation to broad areas of public life, that observation alone would enough to have one denounced as an antisemite. Which is why the Haaretz article ‚Äì far braver than anything you will read in a UK or US newspaper ‚Äì makes no bones about what is happening in Germany. It calls it a ""witch-hunt"". That is Haaretz‚Äôs way of saying that antisemitism has been politicised and weaponised ‚Äì a self-evident conclusion that will currently get you expelled from the British Labour party, even if you are Jewish.

The Haaretz story highlights two important developments in the way antisemitism has been, in the words of intellectuals and cultural leaders cited by the newspaper, ""instrumentalised"" in Germany.

Jewish organisations and their allies in Germany, as Haaretz reports, are openly weaponising antisemitism not only to damage the reputation of Israel‚Äôs harsher critics, but also to force out of the public and cultural domain ‚Äì through a kind of ""antisemitism guilt by association"" ‚Äì anyone who dares to entertain criticism of Israel.

Cultural associations, festivals, universities, Jewish research centres, political think-tanks, museums and libraries are being forced to scrutinise the past of those they wish to invite in case some minor transgression against Israel can be exploited by local Jewish organisations. That has created a toxic, politically paranoid atmosphere that inevitably kills trust and creativity.

But the psychosis runs deeper still. Israel, and anything related to it, has become such a combustible subject ‚Äì one that can ruin careers in an instant ‚Äì that most political, academic and cultural figures in Germany now choose to avoid it entirely. Israel, as its supporters intended, is rapidly becoming untouchable.

A case study noted by Haaretz is Peter Sch√§fer, a respected professor of ancient Judaism and Christianity studies who was forced to resign as director of Berlin‚Äôs Jewish Museum last year. Sch√§fer‚Äôs crime, in the eyes of Germany‚Äôs Jewish establishment, was that he staged an exhibition on Jerusalem that recognised the city‚Äôs three religious traditions, including a Muslim one.

He was immediately accused of promoting ""historical distortions"" and denounced as ""anti-Israel"". A reporter for Israel‚Äôs rightwing Jerusalem Post, which has been actively colluding with the Israeli government to smear critics of Israel, contacted Sch√§fer with a series of inciteful emails. The questions included ""Did you learn the wrong lesson from the Holocaust?"" and ""Israeli experts told me you disseminate antisemitism ‚Äì is that true?""

Sch√§fer observes: ""The accusation of antisemitism is a club that allows one to deal a death blow, and political elements who have an interest in this are using it, without a doubt‚Ä¶ The museum staff gradually entered a state of panic. Then of course we also started to do background checks. Increasingly it poisoned the atmosphere and our work.""

Another prominent victim of these Jewish organisations tells Haaretz: ""Sometimes one thinks, ‚ÄòTo go to that conference?‚Äô ‚ÄòTo invite this colleague?‚Äô Afterward it means that for three weeks, I‚Äôll have to cope with a shitstorm, whereas I need the time for other things that I get paid for as a lecturer. There is a type of ‚Äòanticipatory obedience‚Äô or ‚Äòprior self-censorship.‚Äô""

Ringing off the hook

There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Germany. Jewish organisations are stirring up these ""shitstorms"" ‚Äì designed to paralyse political and cultural life for anyone who engages in even the mildest criticism of Israel ‚Äì at the highest levels of government. Don‚Äôt believe me? Here is Barack Obama explaining in his recent autobiography his efforts as US president to curb Israel‚Äôs expansion of its illegal settlements. Early on, he was warned to back off or face the wrath of the Israel lobby:

""Members of both parties worried about crossing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‚Äòanti-Israel‚Äô (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election.""

When Obama went ahead anyway in 2009 and proposed a modest freeze on Israel‚Äôs illegal settlements:

""The White House phones started ringing off the hook, as members of my national security team fielded calls from reporters, leaders of American Jewish organizations, prominent supporters, and members of Congress, all wondering why we were picking on Israel ‚Ä¶ this sort of pressure continued for much of 2009.""

He observes further:

""The noise orchestrated by Netanyahu had the intended effect of gobbling up our time, putting us on the defensive, and reminding me that normal policy differences with an Israeli prime minister ‚Äì even one who presided over a fragile coalition government ‚Äì exacted a political cost that didn‚Äôt exist when I dealt with the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, or any of our other closest allies.""

Doubtless, Obama dare not put down in writing his full thoughts about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu or the US lobbyists who worked on his behalf. But Obama‚Äôs remarks do show that, even a US president, supposedly the single most powerful person on the planet, ended up blanching in the face of this kind of relentless assault. For lesser mortals, the price is likely to be far graver.

No free speech on Israel

It was this same mobilisation of Jewish organisational pressure ‚Äì orchestrated, as Obama notes, by Israel and its partisans in the US and Europe ‚Äì that ended up dominating Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs five years as the leader of Britain‚Äôs leftwing Labour party, recasting a well-known anti-racism activist almost overnight as an antisemite.

It is the reason why his successor, Sir Keir Starmer, has outsourced part of Labour‚Äôs organisational oversight on Jewish and Israel-related matters to the very conservative Board of Deputies of British Jews, as given expression in Starmer‚Äôs signing up to the Board‚Äôs ""10 Pledges"".

PIC3

It is part of the reason why Starmer recently suspended Corbyn from the party, and then defied the membership‚Äôs demands that he be properly reinstated, after Corbyn expressed concerns about the way antisemitism allegations had been ""overstated for political reasons"" to damage him and Labour. (The rightwing Starmer, it should be noted, was also happy to use antisemitism as a pretext to eradicate the socialist agenda Corbyn had tried to revive in Labour.) It is why Starmer has imposed a blanket ban on constituency parties discussing Corbyn‚Äôs suspension. And it is why Labour‚Äôs shadow education secretary has joined the ruling Conservative party in threatening to strip universities of their funding if they allow free speech about Israel on campus.

Two types of Jews

But the Haaretz article raises another issue critical to understanding how Israel and the Jewish establishment in Europe are politicising antisemitism to protect Israel from criticism. The potential Achilles‚Äô heel of their campaign are Jewish dissidents, those who break with the supposed ""Jewish community"" line and create a space for others ‚Äì whether Palestinians or other non-Jews ‚Äì to criticise Israel. These Jewish dissenters risk serving as a reminder that trenchant criticism of Israel should not result in one being tarred an antisemite.

Israel and Jewish organisations, however, have made it their task to erode that idea by promoting a distinction ‚Äì an antisemitic one, at that ‚Äì between two types of Jews: good Jews (loyal to Israel), and bad Jews (disloyal to Israel).

Haaretz reports that officials in Germany, such as Felix Klein, the country‚Äôs antisemitism commissioner, and Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, are being allowed to define not only who is an antisemite, typically using support for Israel as the yardstick, but are also determining who are good Jews ‚Äì those politically like them ‚Äì and who are bad Jews ‚Äì those who disagree with them.

Despite Germany‚Äôs horrific recent history of Jew hatred, the German government, local authorities, the media, universities and cultural institutions have been encouraged by figures like Klein and Schuster to hound German Jews, even Israeli Jews living and working in Germany, from the country‚Äôs public and cultural space.

When, for example, a group of Israeli Jewish academics in Berlin held a series of online discussions about Zionism last year on the website of their art school, an Israeli reporter soon broke the story of a ""scandal"" involving boycott supporters receiving funding from the German government. Hours later the art school had pulled down the site, while the German education ministry issued a statement clarifying that it had provided no funding. The Israeli embassy officially declared the discussions held by these Israelis as ""antisemitic"", and a German foundation that documents antisemitism added the group to the list of antisemitic incidents it records.

Described as ‚Äòkapos‚Äô

So repressive has the cultural and political atmosphere grown in Germany that there has been a small backlash among cultural leaders. Some have dared to publish a letter protesting against the role of Klein, the antisemitism commissioner. Haaretz reports:

""The antisemitism czar, the letter charged, is working ‚Äòin synergy with the Israeli government‚Äô in an effort ‚Äòto discredit and silence opponents of Israel‚Äôs policies‚Äô and is abetting the ‚Äòinstrumentalization‚Äô that undermines the true struggle against antisemitism.

Figures like Klein have been so focused on tackling criticism of Israel from the left, including the Jewish left, that they have barely noted the ""acute danger Jews in Germany face due to the surge in far-right antisemitism"", the letter argues.

Again, the same picture can be seen across Europe. In the UK, the opposition Labour party, which should be a safe space for those leading the anti-racism struggle, is purging itself of Jews critical of Israel and using anti-semitism smears against prominent anti-racists, especially from other oppressed minorities.

Extraordinarily, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi, one of the founders of Jewish Voice for Labour, which supports Corbyn, recently found herself suspended by Starmer‚Äôs Labour. She had just appeared in a moving video in which she explained the ways antisemitism was being used by Jewish organisations to smear Jewish left-wingers like herself as ""traitors"" and ""kapos"" ‚Äì an incendiary term of abuse, as Wimborne-Idrissi points out, that refers to ""a Jewish inmate of a concentration camp who collaborated with the [Nazi] authorities, people who collaborated in the annihilation of their own people"".

In suspending her, Starmer effectively endorsed this campaign by the UK‚Äôs Jewish establishment of incitement against, and vilification of, leftwing Jews.

Earlier, Marc Wadsworth, a distinguished black anti-racism campaigner, found himself similarly suspended by Labour when he exposed the efforts of Ruth Smeeth, then a Labour MP and a former Jewish official in the Israel lobby group BICOM, to recruit the media to her campaign smearing political opponents on the left as antisemites.

In keeping with the rapid erosion of critical thinking in civil society organisations designed to uphold basic freedoms, Smeeth was recently appointed director of the prestigious free speech organisation Index on Censorship. There she can now work on suppressing criticism of Israel ‚Äì and attack ""bad Jews"" ‚Äì under cover of fighting censorship. In the new, inverted reality, censorship refers not to the smearing and silencing of a ""bad Jew"" like Wimborne-Idrissi, but to criticism of Israel over its human rights abuses, which supposedly ""censors"" the identification of ""good Jews"" with Israel ‚Äì now often seen as the crime of ""causing offence"".

Boy who cried wolf

The Haaretz article helps to contextualise Europe‚Äôs current antisemitism ""witch-hunt"", which targets anyone who criticises Israel or stands in solidarity with oppressed Palestinians, or associates with such people. It is an expansion of the earlier campaign by the Jewish establishment against ""the wrong kind of Jew"", as identified by Finkelstein in The Holocaust Industry. But this time Jewish organisations are playing a much higher-stakes, and more dangerous, political game.

Haaretz rightly fears that the Jewish leadership in Europe is not only silencing ordinary Jews but degrading the meaning ‚Äì the shock value ‚Äì of antisemitism through the very act of politicising it. Jewish organisations risk alienating the European left, which has historically stood with them against Jew hatred from the right. European anti-racists suddenly find themselves equated with, and smeared as, fledgling neo-Nazis.

If those who support human rights and demand an end to the oppression of Palestinians find themselves labelled antisemitic, it will become ever harder to distinguish between bogus (weaponised) ""antisemitism"" on the left and real Jew hatred from the right. The antisemitism smearers ‚Äì and their fellow travellers like Keir Starmer ‚Äì are likely to end up suffering their very own ""boy who cried wolf"" syndrome.

Or as Haaretz notes:

""The issue that is bothering the critics of the Bundestag [German parliament] resolution is whether the extension of the concept of antisemitism to encompass criticism of Israel is not actually adversely affecting the battle against antisemitism. The argument is that the ease with which the accusation is leveled could have the effect of eroding the concept itself.""

The Antisemitism Industry

It is worth noting the shared features of the new Antisemitism Industry and Finkelstein‚Äôs earlier discussions of the Holocaust Industry.

In his book, Finkelstein identifies the ""wrong Jews"" as people like his mother, who survived a Nazi death camp as the rest of her family perished. These surviving Jews, Finkelstein argues, were valued by the Holocaust Industry only in so far as they served as a promotional tool for the Jewish establishment to accumulate more wealth and cultural and political status. Otherwise, the victims were ignored because the actual Holocaust‚Äôs message ‚Äì in contrast to the Jewish leadership‚Äôs representation of it ‚Äì was universal: that we must oppose and fight all forms of racism because they lead to persecution and genocide.

Instead the Holocaust Industry promoted a particularist, self-interested lesson that the Holocaust proves Jews are uniquely oppressed and that they therefore deserve a unique solution: a state, Israel, that must be given unique leeway by western states to commit crimes in violation of international law. The Holocaust Industry ‚Äì very much to be distinguished from the real events of the Holocaust ‚Äì is deeply entwined in, and rationalised by, the perpetuation of the racialist, colonial project of Israel.

In the case of the Antisemitism Industry, the ""wrong Jew"" surfaces again. This time the witch-hunt targets Jewish leftwingers, Jews critical of Israel, Jews opposed to the occupation, and Jews who support a boycott of the illegal settlements or of Israel itself. Again, the problem with these ""bad Jews"" is that they allude to a universal lesson, one that says Palestinians have at least as much right to self-determination, to dignity and security, in their historic homeland as Jewish immigrants who fled European persecution.

In contrast to the ""bad Jews"", the Antisemitism Industry demands that a particularist conclusion be drawn about Israel ‚Äì just as a particularist conclusion was earlier drawn by the Holocaust Industry. It says that to deny Jews a state is to leave them defenceless against the eternal virus of antisemitism. In this conception, the Holocaust may be uniquely abhorrent but it is far from unique. Non-Jews, given the right circumstances, are only too capable of carrying out another Holocaust. Jews must therefore always be protected, always on guard, always have their weapons (or in Israel‚Äôs case, its nuclear bombs) to hand.

‚ÄòGet out of jail‚Äô card

This view, of course, seeks to ignore, or marginalise, other victims of the Holocaust ‚Äì Romanies, communists, gays ‚Äì and other kinds of racism. It needs to create a hierarchy of racisms, a competition between them, in which hatred of Jews is at the pinnacle. This is how we arrived at an absurdity: that anti-Zionism ‚Äì misrepresented as the rejection of a refuge for Jews, rather than the reality that it rejects an ethnic, colonial state oppressing Palestinians ‚Äì is the same as antisemitism.

Extraordinarily, as the Haaretz article clarifies, German officials are oppressing ""bad Jews"", at the instigation of Jewish organisations, to prevent, as they see it, the re-emergence of the far-right and neo-Nazis. The criticisms of Israel made by the ""bad Jew"" are thereby not just dismissed as ideologically unsound or delusions but become proof that these Jews are colluding with, or at least nourishing, the Jew haters.

In this way, Germany, the UK and much of Europe have come to justify the exclusion of the ""wrong Jew"" ‚Äì those who uphold universal principles for the benefit of all ‚Äì from the public space. Which, of course, is exactly what Israel wants, because, rooted as it is in an ideology of ethnic exclusivity as a ""Jewish state"", it necessarily rejects universal ethics.

What we see here is an illustration of a principle at the heart of Israel‚Äôs state ideology of Zionism: Israel needs antisemitism. Israel would quite literally have to invent antisemitism if it did not exist.

This is not hyperbole. The idea that the ""virus of antisemitism"" lies semi-dormant in every non-Jew waiting for a chance to overwhelm its host is the essential rationale for Israel. If the Holocaust was an exceptional historical event, if antisemitism was an ancient racism that in its modern incarnation followed the patterns of prejudice and hatred familiar in all racisms, from anti-black bigotry to Islamophobia, Israel would be not only redundant but an abomination ‚Äì because it has been set up to dispossess and abuse another group, the Palestinians.

Antisemitism is Israel‚Äôs ""get out of jail"" card. Antisemitism serves to absolve Israel of the racism it structurally embodies and that would be impossible to overlook were Israel deprived of the misdirection weaponised antisemitism provides.

An empty space

The Haaretz article provides a genuine service by not only reminding us that ""bad Jews"" exist but in coming to their defence ‚Äì something that European media is no longer willing to do. To defend ""bad Jews"" like Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi is to be contaminated with the same taint of antisemitism that justified the ejection of these Jews from the public space.

Haaretz records the effort of a few brave cultural institutions in Germany to protest, to hold the line, against this new McCarthyism. Their stand may fail. If it does, you may never become aware of it.

Once, the ""bad Jews"" have been smeared into silence, as Palestinians and those who stand in solidarity with them largely have been already; when social media has de-platformed critics of Israel as Jew haters; when the media and political parties enforce this silence so absolutely they no longer need to smear anyone as an antisemite because these ""antisemites"" have been disappeared; when the Jewish ""community"" speaks with one voice because its other voices have been eliminated; when the censorship is complete, you will not know it.

There will be no record of what was lost. There will be simply an empty space, a blank slate, where discussions of Israel‚Äôs crimes against Palestinians once existed. What you will hear instead is only what Israel and its partisans want you to hear. Your ignorance will be blissfully complete.

FREE NORMAN FINKELSTEIN: I NEGAZIONISTI DOVREBBERO INSEGNARE NELLE UNIVERSIT√Ä
28 OTTOBRE 2020 PERCH√â DOVREMMO RALLEGRARCI DEI NEGAZIONISTI DELL‚ÄôOLOCAUSTO, E NON METTERLI A TACERE Una replica all‚Äôamministratore delegato di Facebook Mark Zuckerberg e all‚Äôamministratore delegato di Twitter Jack Dorsey Di Norman G. Finkelstein Facebook e Twitter hanno annunciato che metteranno al bando il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto dalle loro piattaforme. In un libro di prossima uscita, Cancel culture, Academic Freedom and Me, Norman Finkelstein sostiene che il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto dovrebbe essere insegnato nelle universit√† e preferibilmente da un negazionista. Ecco un estratto dal suo manoscritto. Sarebbe una caricatura della verit√† e della libert√† accademica (cos√¨ si dice) se una universit√† permettesse ai negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto una piattaforma. Ma, per cominciare, non √® ovvio cosa esattamente viene negato. L‚Äôolocausto nazista denota lo sterminio dell‚Äôebraismo europeo o tutte le categorie di persone messe sistematicamente a morte e stroncate? Se si tratta solo degli ebrei, allora perch√©? Se il criterio √® quantitativo ‚Äì non meno di 5-6 milioni di ebrei periti ‚Äì perch√© allora l‚Äôolocausto nazista gode di uno status privilegiato, tale da non poter essere messo in discussione? Circa 30 milioni di russi vennero uccisi durante la seconda guerra mondiale, e tuttavia nessuna bandiera rossa impedisce un dibattito a ruota libera su questa letale distruzione. Inoltre, se la singolarit√† dell‚Äôolocausto nazista e il punto della questione consistono nel numero degli uccisi, √® difficile comprendere perch√© dovrebbe essere posto un tab√π sul negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto. La cosa ragionevole non √® semplicemente quella di presentare le prove tecniche della cifra largamente accettata dei 5-6 milioni? Ma forse √® il criterio qualitativo del come che distingue lo sterminio nazista: vale a dire, il processo di tipo industriale simile alla catena di montaggio di una fabbrica culminato nelle camere a gas. Tuttavia, solo la met√† di questi ebrei che morirono vennero uccisi in campi della morte[1], mentre Raul Hilberg, che punta dritto al ‚Äúprocesso di distruzione‚Äù nel suo studio monumentale, nondimeno accomuna l‚Äôolocausto nazista al genocidio del Ruanda (‚ÄúLa storia ha ripetuto s√© stessa‚Äù), sebbene quest‚Äôultimo sia stato eseguito utilizzando le armi pi√π primitive[2]. Ancora, se il punto della contesa √® la tecnica, perch√© allora non limitarsi a lasciare che le prove delle camere a gas parlino per s√© stesse? Se l‚Äôeffetto voluto del tab√π sul negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto √® di sopprimerlo, l‚Äôeffetto reale √® di sollevare sospetti: perch√© i negazionisti vengono imbavagliati se le prove smentiscono incontrovertibilmente le loro affermazioni? In realt√†, il tab√π pu√≤ rivelarsi un boomerang in pi√π direzioni. La International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definisce il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto tra le altre cose come i ‚Äútentativi di attenuare le responsabilit√† dei campi di concentramento e dei campi della morte ideati e gestiti dalla Germania nazista addossando la colpa ad altre nazioni o ad altri gruppi etnici‚Äù[3]. Il Primo Ministro israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu ha addossato la colpa suprema per l‚Äôolocausto nazista al Mufti palestinese di Gerusalemme[4]. Dovrebbe egli essere escluso dall‚Äôaula di un college? Quando insegnavo il Saggio sulla libert√† di John Stuart Mill, testavo le critiche di Mill con un trittico di scenari ipotetici, uno dei quali era: ‚ÄúUn professore del nostro dipartimento di storia vuole riservare una classe del suo corso introduttivo sull‚ÄôEuropa moderna alla proposizione che l‚Äôolocausto nazista non √® mai avvenuto. Si tratta di un corso obbligatorio, in cui il professore non risponde alle domande degli studenti. Gli si dovrebbe permettere di tenere questo corso?‚Äù[5]. Dapprima liquidavo le ovvie obiezioni della classe. Il fatto che il professore zittisca la classe non contraddice Mill? Ma, replicavo, non ascoltate programmi radiofonici, non guardate show televisivi, e non leggete libri rispetto ai quali vi trovate in totale disaccordo e tuttavia non potete fisicamente rispondere? (in realt√†, pi√π spesso che no l‚Äôautore di un testo offensivo non √® pi√π tra i viventi). Una persona razionale chiude le sue orecchie, cambia canale, e fa a pezzi il libro, oppure si occupa delle parole sgradite, a prescindere dal fatto che abbia l‚Äôultima parola o anche la prima? Ancora, la presentazione unilaterale del professore (si dice) contraddice Mill. Ma, ribattevo, non veniamo bombardati con testi e immagini, non da ultimo nelle offerte dei corsi del college ‚Äì che affermano l‚Äôolocausto nazista? Non pu√≤ certo essere giudicato una rottura dei contrappesi il fatto che un singolo professore riservi una singola classe di un singolo corso a contestare la saggezza di un consenso incessantemente articolato. Dopo aver affrontato queste prevedibili obiezioni, iniziava il vero lavoro. A che serve una tale classe se so per certo che l‚Äôolocausto nazista √® avvenuto? Ma non potete essere certi della vostra convinzione fino a quando, e a meno che, non abbiate ascoltato e risposto a tutte le obiezioni a essa. Anche un bambino, se la sua convinzione viene messa in discussione, ha una sufficiente nozione di epistemologia per controbattere: dimostrami che sbaglio! Se lui vuole abbracciare la sua certezza, deve prima occuparsi di ogni suo oppositore. La completa libert√† di contraddire e di confutare la nostra opinione √® la condizione esatta che ci giustifica nel fare propria la sua verit√†‚Ä¶; e in nessun altro modo pu√≤ un essere provvisto di facolt√† umane avere alcuna rassicurazione razionale di essere nel giusto. Le convinzioni che consideriamo pi√π valide possono essere fondate solo su un permanente invito al mondo intero a dimostrarle infondate[6]. Anche se potete schierare una montagna di prove a sostegno, ancora, non potete preferire la vostra convinzione a quella dei negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto se vi rifiutate persino di ascoltarli. Il massimo che potete razionalmente sostenere √® l‚Äôagnosticismo; altrimenti, la vostra convinzione √® basata sul pregiudizio personale, non sulla verit√†. Colui che conosce solo il proprio punto di vista sulla questione conosce poco di essa. Le sue ragioni possono essere buone, e nessuno pu√≤ essere stato capace di confutarle. Ma se egli √® ugualmente incapace di confutare le ragioni del punto di vista opposto, se egli non le conosce in modo approfondito, egli non ha la base per preferire una qualsivoglia opinione. Per costui la posizione razionale sarebbe quella della sospensione del giudizio, e a meno che egli non si accontenti di questa, egli √® o condizionato dall‚Äôautorit√† oppure adotta, come la generalit√† del mondo, il lato per il quale egli prova la maggiore inclinazione[7]. Inoltre, anche se voi non nutrite dubbi, questo non pu√≤ permettervi di decidere per gli altri a meno che non siate onniscienti[8]; quando avete riconosciuto la vostra fallibilit√† umana, dovete anche concedere la possibilit√† di essere in errore, nel qual caso il vostro atto di soppressione potrebbe negare ad altri la possibilit√† di scambiare l‚Äôerrore per la verit√†. Coloro che desiderano di sopprimere [un‚Äôopinione], naturalmente, negano la sua verit√†; ma essi non sono infallibili. Essi non hanno l‚Äôautorit√† per decidere la questione per tutto il genere umano e per escludere ogni altra persona dai mezzi di giudizio‚Ä¶Ogni soppressione della discussione √® un‚Äôassunzione di infallibilit√†. Anche garantendo la fattualit√† dell‚Äôolocausto nazista, fornire ai negazionisti una piattaforma sarebbe ancora giustificato. Proprio come la profondit√† di ‚Äútutti gli uomini sono creati uguali‚Äù (l‚Äôaltro esempio che ho invocato per chiarire il punto di vista di Mill) non √® interamente ovvia, cos√¨ la profondit√† dell‚Äôolocausto nazista non √® interamente ovvia. Se le profondit√† del significato si trovano sepolte in essa, allora, esse possono essere scandagliate solo in una libera discussione. Ci si pu√≤ solo chiedere quanto veloce sia il riflesso di soffocare il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto, anche se gli ingannevoli tab√π ridurranno inevitabilmente una tragedia umana, per quanto profonda, ad uno sterile mantra, ad un oggetto di cieca adorazione, o secondo i termini di Mill, ad un morto dogma. √à anche difficile non lasciarsi sfuggire la proliferazione di linee rosse che proteggono l‚ÄôOlocausto dal correttivo della libert√† di parola, anche ‚Äì o meglio, specialmente ‚Äì quando uno dei suoi postulati fondamentali appare falso. Cos√¨, da un lato, una sanzione senza paragoni viene imposta sul negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto ‚Äì nemmeno il negazionismo del cambiamento climatico, che minaccia la sopravvivenza stessa del pianeta, √® cos√¨ sanzionato! ‚Äì mentre, d‚Äôaltro canto, dimostrare l‚Äôunicit√† dell‚Äôolocausto nazista si √® rivelato difficile da definire e, cosa pi√π importante, negare la sua unicit√†, e anche giustapporlo ad altri crimini storici ‚Äì solo per mostrare che non pu√≤ essere paragonato ‚Äì viene interpretato come una forma di negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto[9]. Pi√π i tab√π vengono moltiplicati, pi√π l‚Äôolocausto nazista viene disancorato dal tempo e dallo spazio e ridotto ad un oggetto di idolatria. Per quanto vera possa essere, se non viene discussa pienamente, frequentemente e senza timori reverenziali, essa verr√† conservata come un morto dogma, non come una verit√† vivente. Non solo le fondamenta dell‚Äôopinione vengono dimenticate nell‚Äôassenza di discussione, ma troppo spesso il significato dell‚Äôopinione stessa. Le parole che la esprimono cessano di suggerire idee, o suggeriscono solo una piccola porzione di quelle che vennero originariamente impiegate per comunicare. Al posto di una vivida concezione e di una vivente convinzione, rimangono l√¨ solo poche frasi conservate a memoria; o, se si conserva una parte, vengono conservati solo il guscio e la buccia del significato, l‚Äôessenza superiore viene perduta. Non hanno i tab√π che avvolgono l‚Äôolocausto nazista ‚Äì la paura di metterlo in discussione (o di mettere in discussione aspetti di esso), lo status sacrosanto che occupa ‚Äì indotto a calcificarlo in un rituale privo di vita, ma hanno anche generato una grande quantit√† di letteratura testimoniale spuria e una pseudo-erudizione insensata, l‚Äôesito paradossale delle quali √® di fornire foraggio ai mulini dei negazionisti?[10] Se un presunto testimone gode di immunit√† dal contro-interrogatorio ‚Äì come fa ogni Tom, Dick, e Moishe che impegna la propria parola come un ‚Äúsopravvissuto dell‚ÄôOlocausto‚Äù[11] ‚Äì la propensione umana √® quella di esagerare, la quale, se viene lasciata priva di controlli, si indurir√† in una menzogna. C‚Äô√® sempre una speranza quando le persone vengono costrette ad ascoltare entrambi i punti di vista; √® quando esse ne seguono solo uno che gli errori diventano pregiudizi, e la verit√† stessa cessa di avere l‚Äôeffetto della verit√† venendo esagerata fino a diventare una falsit√†. √à anche possibile (persino probabile) individuare il contesto generale nel modo corretto anche se alcuni dei fatti costitutivi sono sbagliati. Se uno √® devoto alla purezza della verit√†, non solo nella sua interezza ma anche nelle sue componenti, allora un negazionista dell‚ÄôOlocausto esercita l‚Äôutile funzione di scoprire gli errori ‚Äúlocali‚Äù, precisamente perch√© √® un avvocato del diavolo ‚Äì e cio√®, dedito in modo fanatico a ‚Äúsmascherare‚Äù l‚Äô‚Äùimpostura del 20¬∞ secolo‚Äù. Egli conseguentemente impiega tutto il suo essere nel vagliare ogni elemento di prova, senza dare per scontato il pi√π piccolo dettaglio, passando la pettinina attraverso ognuno di questi e, nel suo zelo monomaniacale di scovare un errore, finisce inevitabilmente per scoprirlo. Anche se il mondo intero √® nel giusto, √® sempre probabile che i dissidenti abbiano qualcosa che vale la pena di ascoltare, e che la verit√† perderebbe qualcosa con il loro silenzio[12]. ‚ÄúSe queste persone vogliono parlare, permetteteglielo‚Äù, consigliava Hilberg. ‚ÄúTutto ci√≤ avrebbe il solo effetto di indurre quelli di noi che fanno ricerca a riesaminare quello che possiamo aver considerato come ovvio. E questo √® utile‚Äù[13]. Se egli era rilassato quando si trattava dei negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto, √® perch√© Hilberg era fiducioso nelle sue conclusioni basate sulla sua padronanza delle fonti. L‚Äôimpulso di mettere a tacere nasce non solo dal disgusto per ci√≤ che i negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto scandalosamente proclamano ma anche, e pi√π spesso, dalla paura dell‚Äôincapacit√† di rispondere loro in modo credibile[14]. ‚ÄúS√¨, c‚Äô√® stato un Olocausto‚Äù, osserv√≤ Hilberg una volta, ‚Äúche √®, naturalmente, pi√π facile da affermare che da dimostrare‚Äù[15]. Se voi avete assolto il vostro compito, allora rispondere a sgradevoli scettici √® alla peggio una forma di divertimento intellettuale, l‚Äôequivalente mentale di sparare ad un pesce in un barile. La conclusione √® che, collocando sotto un microscopio e ispezionando da ogni angolo ogni frammento di prova, il negazionista dell‚ÄôOlocausto sta facendo per voi quello che voi, se siete genuinamente devoti alla verit√†, dovreste fare da voi stessi; la differenza √® che quella del negazionista √® l‚Äôispezione pi√π scrupolosa perch√© √® molto pi√π difficile argomentare contro voi stessi quando vi siete radicati o avete sviluppato un interesse personale nella vostra convinzione. Cos√¨, lungi dal mettere a tacere i negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto, uno dovrebbe essere grato ad essi per aver facilitato ‚Äì per quanto in modo involontario ‚Äì la ricerca della verit√†. N√© √® sufficiente che egli debba ascoltare gli argomenti degli avversari dai propri insegnanti, presentati come essi li declinano, e accompagnati da ci√≤ che essi offrono come confutazione. Questo non √® il modo per rendere giustizia agli argomenti, o per portarli ad un contatto reale con la propria mente. Egli deve essere capace di ascoltarli dalle persone che credono davvero ad essi; che li difendono sul serio e che fanno del loro meglio per essi. Egli li deve conoscere nella loro forma pi√π plausibile e persuasiva; egli deve sentire l‚Äôintera forza della difficolt√† che la vera visione dell‚Äôargomento deve incontrare e risolvere; altrimenti egli non si impossesser√† mai della porzione di verit√† che incontra e rimuover√† quella difficolt√†. Se vi sono delle persone che contestano un‚Äôopinione ricevuta, o che si comporteranno in tal modo se la legge o l‚Äôopinione glielo permetteranno, ringraziamoli per questo, apriamo le nostre menti al loro ascolto, e rallegriamoci che vi sia qualcuno che fa per noi quello che noi dovremmo fare altrimenti, se abbiamo una qualche considerazione per la certezza o la vitalit√† delle nostre convinzioni, con molta pi√π grande fatica da parte nostra. L‚Äôovvio ammonimento dell‚Äôargomento milliano √® che √® cosa buona e giusta lasciare che i negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto esercitino il loro mestiere indisturbati nella pubblica arena, e persino tollerarli come conferenzieri se un‚Äôorganizzazione universitaria dovesse scegliere di invitarli, ma non si applica ad una classe una diversa serie di regole? Proprio come i pari di uno studioso devono sottoporre ad una verifica il merito erudito dei testi presentati per la pubblicazione (altrimenti l‚Äôaccademia degenera in una rissa verbale generalizzata), cos√¨ un dipartimento di storia deve sottoporre a verifica le offerte dei propri corsi: le economie del tempo impediscono di ispezionare un evento storico critico da ogni possibile angolo. Come pu√≤ giustificarsi lo sperperare anche una sola classe di un corso su una proposizione ciarlatanesca? √à sicuramente legittimo discutere se la guerra civile americana venne combattuta per i diritti degli stati o per la schiavit√π, o se la tratta degli schiavi √® meglio o peggio della schiavit√π salariata. Parimenti, molte questioni basilari riguardanti la Soluzione Finale non sono ancora state risolte; in realt√†, esiste ancora una controversia sul quando essa inizi√≤ e sul perch√© Hitler la attu√≤. Ma il discutere se accadde oppure no non sarebbe frivolo come il discutere se oppure no lo schiavismo esistette nel Sud pre-bellico? Posta cos√¨, la domanda risponde a s√© stessa. Tuttavia, c‚Äô√® una differenza cruciale. Coloro che concionano contro la virt√π del ‚Äúcontrappeso‚Äù ‚Äì vale a dire contro l‚Äôesporre in classe tutti i lati di una proposizione ‚Äì e che brandiscono il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto come una prova positiva che il contrappeso √® assurdo, simultaneamente presumono che il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto costituisca un pericolo incipiente o addirittura imminente nella societ√†. Ma se esso pone una minaccia cos√¨ grave per la popolazione generale[16], come pu√≤ essere disinnescato in altro modo che affrontandolo direttamente, non in una versione addomesticata (la sua confutazione non persuaderebbe), ma nella sua versione pi√π virulenta espressa dall‚Äôavvocato del diavolo? La risposta sicuramente non pu√≤ essere quella di sopprimere il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto ricorrendo alla censura o alla forza pubblica. Lo scopo di un‚Äôuniversit√† √® la ricerca della verit√†, non l‚Äôimposizione di idee ‚Äúcorrette‚Äù. Parimenti, √® quasi impossibile reprimere un‚Äôidea ‚Äúscorretta‚Äù, mentre, una volta che abbia preso piede, si diffonder√† con facilit√† presso una popolazione ignorante degli argomenti contro di essa, e conseguentemente mentalmente disarmata per contrastarla. Raramente √® possibile escludere completamente la discussione, e una volta che essa entra in gioco, le credenze non basate sulla convinzione tendono a cedere di fronte alla minima parvenza di un argomento[17]. Se, per ipotesi, si mette da parte il fatto che, in primo luogo, il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto non pu√≤ essere soppresso se l‚Äô‚ÄùOlocausto‚Äù non denota un oggetto distinto e stabile e che, in secondo luogo, il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto comprende in gran parte distinte asserzioni fattuali che possono essere liquidate con distinte confutazioni fattuali, allora la conclusione √® questa. Se il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto √® un fenomeno marginale, allora, alla luce della responsabilit√† di una facolt√† di familiarizzare gli studenti, non con ogni ultima parola su un argomento, ma solo con ‚Äúle migliori espressioni pubblicate delle questioni affrontate‚Äù[18], forse non dovrebbe essere insegnato nella classe di un college perch√© non figura nei dibattiti accademici correnti sulla genesi e sui contorni dell‚Äôolocausto nazista, sebbene i negazionisti esercitino, quantunque inavvertitamente, una funzione preziosa nella societ√† in generale, tale che ostacolerebbe il perseguimento della verit√† metterli a tacere del tutto. Se, tuttavia, il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto costituisce un contagio attuale o potenziale, allora esso dovrebbe essere insegnato, preferibilmente dai negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto, anche se solo per vaccinare gli studenti. Professare, nello stesso tempo, che il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto non dovrebbe essere insegnato e che esso costituisce un pericolo chiaro e attuale, sfida la logica. La tesi dell‚Äôamministratore delegato di Facebook Mark Zuckerberg e dell‚Äôamministratore delegato di Twitter Jack Dorsey che un presunto aumento globale dell‚Äôantisemitismo e l‚Äôignoranza dell‚Äôolocausto nazista giustificano la soppressione del negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto √® parimenti privo di logica. Poscritto. Questo articolo √® stato sottoposto a molte pubblicazioni ‚Äúprogressiste‚Äù che propagandano il principio della libert√† di parola. √à stato rifiutato da tutte. √à un eloquente commento alla dedizione della cosiddetta Sinistra per la libert√† di parola il fatto che non solo essa sostenga la soppressione del negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto, ma anche la soppressione della discussione razionale ‚Äì basata sui principi pi√π elementari della libert√† di parola ‚Äì sull‚Äôopportunit√† oppure no che esso debba essere soppresso. Ci√≤ che pi√π diverte √® che, mentre questa insensata Politica Identitaria pretende di difendere gli ebrei contro il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto, questa scandalosa soppressione della libert√† di parola non ha nulla a che fare con il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto. Se l‚Äôintegrit√† del martirio del popolo ebraico √® stata diffamata, questo √® in massima parte dovuto, non ai negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto, ma alle macchinazioni delle organizzazioni ebraiche che hanno sfruttato l‚Äôolocausto nazista per profitti finanziari e politici. Come al solito, l‚ÄôOlocausto viene ora sfruttato per promuovere un‚Äôagenda del tutto differente. In effetti, immediatamente dopo che Facebook aveva annunciato la sua decisione di sopprimere il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto, il Board of Deputies of British Jews chiedeva a Facebook di sopprimere anche l‚Äô‚Äùantisemitismo‚Äù adottando una definizione di antisemitismo volta a proteggere Israele dalle critiche. Ma l‚Äôinfinitamente stupida, sciocca, codarda, simulatrice, opportunista ‚Äì e, che ci√≤ non sia omesso, avanguardista-totalitaria ‚Äì cosiddetta Sinistra non vedr√† tutto ci√≤, proprio come non ha visto che gli attacchi contro Jeremy Corbyn non avevano nulla a che vedere con l‚Äôantisemitismo. Chi pu√≤ dimenticare il ripugnante spettacolo del perennemente progressista Mehdi Hasan che faceva comunella con il mercante dell‚ÄôOlocausto Jonathan Freedland per condannare l‚Äôantisemitismo nel Partito Laburista britannico? Traduzione di Andrea Carancini. Il testo originale √® disponibile all‚Äôindirizzo: ¬†http://normanfinkelstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Finkelstein-HDeny.pdf [1] Non meno di un quarto del totale vennero messi in riga e fucilati in centri di uccisione. [2] Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, terza edizione (New Haven: 2003), vol. 3, pp. 1294-96. [3] https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-holocaust-denial-and-distortion. Questa definizione del negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto comprende cinque tab√π. Gli altri quattro sono gli ‚Äúsforzi intenzionali di scusare o minimizzare l‚Äôimpatto dell‚ÄôOlocausto o dei suoi elementi principali, inclusi i collaboratori e gli alleati della Germania nazista‚Äù; la ‚Äúminimizzazione grossolana del numero delle vittime dell‚ÄôOlocausto in contraddizione con le fonti attendibili‚Äù; i ‚Äútentativi di incolpare gli ebrei di aver provocato il loro genocidio‚Äù; le ‚Äúaffermazioni che ritraggono l‚ÄôOlocausto come un evento storico positivo‚Äù. [4] ‚ÄúNetanyahu: Hitler didn‚Äôt want to exterminate the Jews‚Äù [‚ÄúNetanyahu: Hitler non voleva sterminare gli ebrei‚Äù] Haaretz (21 October 2015). [5] Gli altri due scenari erano: Una professoressa del nostro dipartimento di biologia vuole riservare una classe del suo corso di genetica alla proposizione che le persone di colore sono intellettualmente inferiori al popolo bianco; Un professore del nostro dipartimento di antropologia vuole riservare una classe del suo corso di cultura comparata alla proposizione che in alcune culture le donne godono di essere picchiate e stuprate. Quando insegnavo in Turchia, sostituii lo scenario del negazionista dell‚ÄôOlocausto con: Un insegnante del dipartimento di religione vuole riservare una classe del suo corso sulla religione comparata alla proposizione che l‚ÄôIslam √® una religione terroristica. [6] Tutte le citazioni in grassetto sono tratte dal Saggio sulla libert√†. [7] Io farei l‚Äôanalogia con un cliente che dice a un impiegato della Baskin-Robbins che la vaniglia √® il suo gusto preferito. ‚ÄúMa lei ha assaggiato gli altri 30 gusti?‚Äù. ‚ÄúNon ne ho bisogno. Io amo la vaniglia. √à soffice, √® dolce, √® cremosa, ha quella sensazione di formicolio‚Äù. ‚ÄúLe sue ragioni possono essere eccellenti, signore, ma se non ha assaggiato gli altri gusti, come pu√≤ preferire la vaniglia?‚Äù. [8] Chiederei scherzosamente allo studente che proclama la sua certezza: ‚ÄúSei Dio?‚Äù. [9] Norman G. Finkelstein, The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the exploitation of Jewish suffering, second edition (New York: 2003), pp. 41-55. [10] Finkelstein, Holocaust Industry, pp. 55-78. Una spiegazione pi√π completa prenderebbe in considerazione l‚Äôutilit√† ideologica che fornisce moneta a questa assurdit√† (vedi ibid.). [11] Ibid., pp. 158-61, 236-39. [12] Vorrei paragonarla in classe all‚Äôincompletezza estetica di un mosaico quando manca una tessera, ad un puzzle quando manca un pezzo, o alle parole crociate quando manca una lettera. Proprio come i matematici parlano di una prova ‚Äúelegante‚Äù, cos√¨ la verit√† ha la sua propria estetica che √® senza difetti. [13] Christopher Hitchens, ‚ÄúHitler‚Äôs Ghost,‚Äù Vanity Fair (June 1996). Hilberg osserv√≤ privatamente che sono stati i negazionisti dell‚ÄôOlocausto che hanno dimostrato che lo Zyklon B nella sua forma pura non era sufficientemente letale per essere stato utilizzato nelle camere a gas. [14] ‚ÄúRidurre al silenzio un oppositore‚Äù, osservava un discepolo del giorno d‚Äôoggi di Mill, ‚Äúsuona allarmante come un‚Äôammissione che non possiamo rispondergli‚Äù. Conrad Russell, Academic Freedom (New York 1993), p. 44. [15] ‚ÄúIs There a New Anti-Semitism?¬† A conversation with Raul Hilberg,‚Äù Logos (Winter-Spring 2007; http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_6.1-2/hilberg.htm). Ricordo vividamente la mia frustrazione intellettuale nello studiare il libro L‚Äôimpostura del 20¬∞ secolo del negazionista dell‚ÄôOlocausto Arthur Butz. Egli correttamente osservava, per esempio, che originariamente si riteneva che tre milioni di ebrei erano stati uccisi ad Auschwitz, e che complessivamente sei milioni di ebrei erano stati uccisi. La cifra del numero degli uccisi ad Auschwitz venne successivamente ridotta ad un milione, e tuttavia la cifra totale era ancora quella dei sei milioni. Come pu√≤ essere tutto ci√≤?, chiedeva Butz retoricamente. Io non avevo la risposta. [16] In realt√†, il pericolo √® largamente inventato (Finkelstein, Holocaust Industry, pp. 68-71), ma questa √® una questione a parte. Qui sto esaminando l‚Äôargomento di coloro che evocano il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto per chiudere la partita contro il contrappeso, ma che presumono anche che il negazionismo dell‚ÄôOlocausto costituisca un chiaro e attuale pericolo. [17] Ero solito fare l‚Äôanalogia con la messa al bando da parte della Germania della pubblicazione del Mein Kampf: se la Germania fosse davvero dedita a impedire una ricomparsa del nazismo, renderebbe obbligatorio lo studio critico del Mein Kampf.

How to dive deep into political theory and philosophy: The Big List,da0qfs,chomsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/da0qfs/how_to_dive_deep_into_political_theory_and/,"This is a list of (largely) contemporary thinkers, books and video content aimed as a reference for questions like -

>**""What should I read next?"", ""Who should I follow?"" or ""What are the best resources for** [certain political topic]?""

The core list comes from Chomsky, and the books and people he's cited or praised. But the list has significantly expanded since then. Feel free to comment about any good books or channels you think should be on this list.

**The best arguments for major mainstream political positions:**

* * *

**Fascism and Neo-Conservatism** 

*On Dictatorship* and *The Concept of The Political* Carl Schmitt

Note:

>Some have argued that neoconservativism has been influenced by Schmitt Most notably the legal opinions offered by Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo et al. by invoking the unitary executive theory to justify highly controversial policies in the war on terror‚Äîsuch as introducing unlawful combatant status which purportedly would eliminate protection by the Geneva Conventions torture, NSA electronic surveillance program‚Äîmimic his writings.Professor David Luban said in 2011 that ""[a] Lexis search reveals five law review references to Schmitt between 1980 and 1990; 114 between 1990 and 2000; and 420 since 2000, with almost twice as many in the last five years as the previous five""

I've added a couple new direct links to books below which were too large to include in the download (*Blood Lies* and *Make-Believe Media*). This is a collection of books covering a wide range of topics: Soviet socialism and its achievements, the crimes of US imperialism, and much more. 

One topic that's covered in these books (*Managing Dissent* and the series of articles by *Cats, Not War*) which I feel doesn't get as much attention as it should is ""soft"" imperialism: NGOs with connections to the US state department, that market themselves as ""humanitarian"". These NGOs operate in the ""civilian political-legal space"" of target countries which are unfriendly to US economic desires. They can be thought of as non-military assets of Anglo-American/European imperialism. 

Because NGOs generally enjoy legal protection to an extent and don't explicitly aid military operations, they are less suspect. This quality allows them to act as trojan horses: excellent tools for undermining socialist/progressive governments. These NGOs get people to support US imperialism with an impressive campaign that's dressed as ""radical"" and ""people oriented"", but it actually serves Anglo-American & European financial interests. 

Examples include the ""Otpor"" student movement in Serbia which led to the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. More recent examples include Avaaz, a ""human rights"" outfit funded by the regime change architect George Soros, and its call for a no-fly zone over Libya and Syria. The imposition of a NATO no-fly zone over Libya was the start of dismantling the social and political gains that the Libyan people under Qadaffi enjoyed for decades, such as universal healthcare, guaranteed housing and a livable wage. I put this here just so it doesn't seem like I'm  spamming a list of books with scarcely any context.

Protect Yourself: r/PrivacyToolsIO",7/1/2018 20:38,,,,,,
On the comparisons of the meat industry to the Holocaust,m8ki5o,vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/m8ki5o/on_the_comparisons_of_the_meat_industry_to_the/,"I have heard again and again, mostly from people who had thankfully never had experience with the holocaust or lost loved ones to the Nazis, that comparisons between the 11 million humans murdered in the Holocaust and the 100 billion non-humans murdered every year by the meat industry is ""offensive"". A particularly vile example of this attitude comes from an article called ""dear vegans, stop comparing animal slaughter to the holocaust""

Some especially manipulative and cruel quotes from the above article are:

"" You think that animal testing is bad? At least it has an objective use"" (This, of course, ignore the fact that most animal testing involves doing things with no objective use, such as bringing up baby raboins in solitary confinement to see if they are still capable of singing, or impaling baby monkeys with metal needles when they're still alive, or electrocuting dogs every day until they develop extreme depression)

"" I don‚Äôt care if you clog my feed up with poor turtles being ripped from their shells. ""

"" I‚Äôm here to tell you to stop re-victimizing my people. Minimizing the horrors they‚Äôve experienced doesn‚Äôt help the planet become a vegan utopia, it brings it back decades. ""

"" In fact, you‚Äôre falling prey to Hitler ideology ‚Äî that Jewish people are subhuman. The Nazis believed my grandparents were as savage as beasts. They used propaganda to compare us to rodents and other fauna. This was a means of numbing society‚Äôs hearts to us, to tolerate and even get people to carry out our mass murder. Now you‚Äôre doing the same. ""

This line of argument is disturbing and absurd. We're not trying to say ""the way we treat animals is great, and that's exactly how we should treat humans"". What we're trying to say is that we shouldn't treat animals in the sick way that they are being treated, and instead treat them with the respect we rightly afford to innocent humans. To try and flip it, and compare vegans to ""Nazis"", and to spread the lie that most vegans that make this argument are actually trying to say that ""the Jewish people are subhuman"" is a level of evil that I cannot quite imagine.

And here are, I think, some rather more pertinent quotes.

&#x200B;

Isaac Bashevis Singer, whose mother and several members of his family were murdered by the Nazis in Poland, writes ""The treatment man inflicts upon the creatures of God make a mockery of all his ideals and his so-called humanism...they have convinced themselves that man, the worst transgressor of all the species, is the crown of creation. All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, experimented.  In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka...""

&#x200B;

Lucy, whose two young sisters were murdered by the Nazis in front of her father, said ""I have been haunted my whole life by the images of the Shoah, and there is no doubt that I was attracted to animal rights in part because of the similarities I felt between the institutionalised exploitation of animals and the Nazi genocide""

&#x200B;

Natalie Portman, an actress of Jewish descent who I have a TREMENDOUS amount of respect for, also compared the animal slaughter to the Holocaust ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XxRzLMYfWo&ab\_channel=PETAAsia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XxRzLMYfWo&ab_channel=PETAAsia) ). She quoted Isaac Singer when he said ""‚ÄòWe do to God‚Äôs creatures what the Nazis did to us‚Äô"".

&#x200B;

A rather excellent article was written by the Jewish scientist Yuval Noah Harari entitled 'Industrial farming is one of the worst crimes in history'.

&#x200B;

It begins by saying ""Animals are the main victims of history, and the treatment of domesticated animals in [industrial farms](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/farming-ecosystems-prince-charles) is perhaps the worst crime in history. The march of human progress is strewn with dead animals. Even tens of thousands of years ago, our stone age ancestors were already responsible for a series of ecological disasters. ""

Comparisons of Israel and Nazism are antisemitic,9pwp6v,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/9pwp6v/comparisons_of_israel_and_nazism_are_antisemitic/," A couple of days ago, amid a proposal for new rules, there was a discussion about whether we should allow comparisons between Israel and Nazism and whether such comparisons constitute antisemitism. To contribute to this debate, I have translated from Norwegian a document I wrote when this question was heavily discussed in Norway after a vile caricature in one of our biggest newspapers, but I also touch on other points towards the end. The caricature in question is [this one](https://www.miff.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-07_13-18-24-2.jpg), drawn in response to Israel‚Äôs nation-state law, and it is also worth noting that the cartoonist Finn Graff drew [an even more defaming caricature](https://honestreporting.com/graffs_spree/) in 2006. I don‚Äôt expect anybody to agree with all my reasons for why such comparisons are antisemitic, but I hope most can at least sympathise with some of my concerns. 

&#x200B;

Note that this document was never meant to be published but is instead a combination of my personal reflections and an anthology of arguments for future reference. As such, I borrowed some formulations and arguments from different sources *without* due credit, including heavily from the post by Ros and some of its comments. I apologise for not being able to denote exactly which parts are original and which are not, but I think the most important thing is to make viewpoints such as these available, regardless of who originally conceived them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am adamant that comparisons between Israel and Nazism are antisemitic, but it has unfortunately not been adequately argued for this view in the public debate. Drawing parallels between Nazism and Israel is fortunately included in IHRA‚Äôs definition of antisemitism, which is the most used and recognised. Using this as an argument for why the caricature is antisemitic is, however, quite circular, so I will here attempt to elucidate why such comparisons are problematic.

&#x200B;

The nation-state law that the caricature is responding to has been controversial, and even in Israel have parts of the bill been heavily criticised. Despite this, it is hard to dispute that Israel also here have been subject to double standards. Nobody has through this bill lost any civil rights, and even the most controversial aspects resemble constitutions of other nation-states that are accepted as liberal democracies. The motivation for this discrimination is, however, not necessarily antisemitic. It could, for instance, derive from sheer ignorance, which is understandable given the biased reporting of our media, or mere virtue signalling, as condemnations of Israel has become a necessity in some circles to be regarded as liberal and progressive.

&#x200B;

The most obvious problem is that the comparison weaponises Jewish history to score a cheap, political point. The underlying message is that the Holocaust was almost a historical justice; the causality is reversed and suggests that the Jews‚Äô behaviour today justifies their treatment yesterday. This is a classic example of victim blaming. The comparison thus corroborates conspiracy theories of Jews exploiting Europe‚Äôs conscience from WW2 for personal benefit. The ‚ÄúHolocaust Industry‚Äù Jews purportedly engage in is an elaborate strategy to achieve impunity to commit their own Holocaust, namely genocide/ethnic cleansing/apartheid/whatever-is-the-new-trendy-accusation to the Palestinians.

&#x200B;

Virtually every educated person knows it‚Äôs ahistorical to compare Nazi-Germany to contemporary Israel. Nazism represents the genocide of European Jews and does in no way resemble the current situation in Palestine. The comparison is so inaccurate, and minimise the Holocaust to such a degree, that such caricatures borders on Holocaust denial. The comparison is, however, so unreasonable that even the most na√Øve is unlikely to be convinced. The goal is rather to cynically displace the debate‚Äôs extremity such that ignorant recipients, who assume that reality lies roughly in the middle between the extremities, will adjust their beliefs in their direction.

&#x200B;

Nazism is today the epitomising symbol of the ultimate evil. To compare Israel to Nazism should, therefore, be understood as a modern manifestation of classical antisemitic tropes about how Jews are particularly bloodthirsty. The consequence of this line of thinking is the moral imperative of combating Israel as a uniquely evil force. In addition, it corroborates conspiratory descriptions of Jew, which are important sources of modern antisemitism.

&#x200B;

As many public voices have noted, it is paradoxical that Graff portrays precisely Israel as Nazilike. A hallmark of authoritarian ideologies is that they silence political opponents with violence. Israel is, to the contrary, a liberal democracy with the strongest freedom of speech in the region, while caricatures against Islam put cartoonists in such a danger that Graff understandably refuses to draw Muhammad. Lars Kolbeinstveit explains intelligently: ‚ÄúThe paradox is glaringly obvious: I will call you a Nazi until you threaten with violence ‚Äì then I will stop, cause then you are an actual Nazi.‚Äù

&#x200B;

There are naturally certain aspects of Nazi-Germany that are similar to Israel, just as for any other country. But comparisons to Nazism should only be used when what is compared is unique to Nazism. (It is, therefore, legitimate to compare BDS with the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, but a general comparison would be unfit.) If one, for instance, wants to criticise a lack of freedom of speech, principles of the Rechtsstaat, or excessive military force, there are a range of other examples that can be used. Nazi-Germany is not considered the world‚Äôs most brutal regime because of the aforementioned misdeeds. Such comparisons thereby whitewash countless assaults on Jews and should be considered double antisemitic by both exaggerating Israel‚Äôs actions and trivialising the Holocaust. Nazism instead provokes associations to concentration camps and a systematic extermination policy that resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. The comparison is deliberatively chosen to evoke a maximum amount of agony for Jews, who are thereby punished with their own grief. This is the very definition of racism, where a person‚Äôs identity is used to attack them.

&#x200B;

Some have pointed out that there is a greater acceptance to compare other countries or groups (e.g. Trump) with Nazis, so why are such comparisons suddenly verboten when they concern Israel? Caricatures don‚Äôt exist in a historical vacuum. Just as it is racist to caricature Obama as a monkey, it is different to do that with Trump. If we wish to criticise the behaviour of a rape victim, we will naturally not compare their behaviour to rape, and if the person is a cancer patient or has lost family members to cancer, we should not compare their behaviour to cancer. Comparing Israel to Nazism similarly uses the victim‚Äôs history as a weapon and is therefore substantially different from comparing other countries to Nazism.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, Nazism has become a banal example of things we find repulsive, and many people, therefore, believe that such caricatures should not be understood literally and should instead be tolerated. Analogies to Nazism are used for everything between USA‚Äôs reprehensible treatment of illegal immigrants to people who are particularly concerned about grammar. Such comparisons, whether they involve Jews or not, minimise the seriousness of the Holocaust. This might make us Europeans feel better about our own misdeeds towards Jews. The Holocaust is demoted from its exceptional spot in world history and becomes instead an ordinary phenomenon. This relativism removes the notion of the absolute evil the Holocaust was and is, therefore, a very liberating thought.

&#x200B;

The biggest problem with such comparison is how they suggest an abhorrent inversion of how Jews ought to behave in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The aim is supposedly to point out a historic irony in that Jews who have themselves been subject to oppression, and therefore now has a special responsibility to ensure it won‚Äôt be repeated to other groups, now act just as their slaughterers. The notion that Jews should be held to a higher standard because of their suffering during the Holocaust is deplorable. ¬´That the extermination of the Jews should have an educational effect on the Jewish people‚Äù, as B√•rd Larsen aptly criticised it. Jews are thereby made victims a second time, just because they have been victims before. An unachievable moral standard is constructed such that it is easier to attack them, and if they don‚Äôt fulfil this they are regarded as a reflection of their own perpetrators and hypocrites for commemorating the Holocaust. This reasoning is particularly problematic because it ostensibly only applies to Jews. Palestinian terrorism, for instance, is on the contrary often defended and rationalised by their history of being victims of oppression. It is quite ironic that European non-Jews (particularly Finn Graff, who was born in Nazi-Germany to a German war pilot) are able to conclude that it‚Äôs the Jews, namely the victims and not the perpetrators of the world‚Äôs gravest crime, that must learn a lesson from the Holocaust. Rabbi Joav Melchior noted that ‚ÄúIt is an absurdity that Europeans choose to use their own civilisational breakdown to chastise their old victims.‚Äù To illustrate just how unreasonable this is, we can consider the following scenario. A vegan who believes it is unjustifiable to consume meat encounters a meat-eating rape victim and says: ‚ÄúHow ironic. You, who have been a victim of rape, have a special responsibility to ensure that all living creatures are treated with dignity. But alas, it looks like the victim has become the perpetrator.‚Äù The analogy is, perhaps, more apt if it‚Äôs precisely her own molester who delivers the moralising comment. 

&#x200B;

One main defence is that this caricature and other Nazi comparisons are solely an attack on Netanyahu and the Israeli government. These are, in fact, not speaking on behalf of all Jews, and the caricature is therefore not an attack on Jews in general. The problem with this reasoning is that the caricature is based off an exploit of Jewish (not Israeli) history, and it is therefore also perceived as an attack on Jews as such. Regardless, it is important to remember that in addition to being an ordinary state, Israel is also the biggest collective of Jews. It is a state all Jews have an emotional attachment to and their only life insurance if the situation in Europe deteriorates further. Just as criticism of Israel is not necessarily antisemitic, one is not automatically exculpated for antisemitism just by concealing one‚Äôs bigotry in a euphemistic veil of anti-Zionism or anti-Israelism. It is certainly antisemitic if it‚Äôs only the Jewish people one wishes to deny self-determination, only the Jewish state one refuses the right to exist, and only products from Israel one considers deserving of a boycott. It does not help to point out that certain fringe, Jewish organisations, such as Jewish Voice for Peace, share these sentiments. These are organisations who abuse their Jewish ancestry to give credence to antisemitic viewpoints, and one thereby admits that they will only support Jews if they accept to be subservient. It is quite bizarre to argue that something can only be called antisemitic if it concerns all Jews and if Jews unanimously acknowledge its antisemitism. Is, for instance, an attack on the Jewish synagogue of Oslo not antisemitic because it does not represent all (e.g. reform) Jews? Even Hitler had Jews he awarded special protection (the family doctor Eduard Bloch), so such a narrow definition is clearly unsatisfactory. 

&#x200B;

In a time where antisemitism is often disguised as Israel hatred and where many Israel advocates are accused of pulling the ‚Äúantisemitism card‚Äù to silence criticism towards Israel, it is increasingly important to be able to distinguish between legitimate criticism of Israeli policies and antisemitic demonisation. It is therefore paramount that we can say we disagree with a bill that declares Israel a Jewish nation-state without simultaneously saying that Israel are Nazis. Comparing the genocide of 6 million Jews with a symbolic law will naturally delegitimise the entire argument for all Jews. It is therefore obvious that the aim of such comparisons is demonisation and not constructive criticism to improve Israeli policies. The hope for a factual debate withers and the conversation collapses before it ever gets the chance to begin.",10/20/2018 21:52,,,,,,

"[/u/cordis_melum - April 24, 2015 at 05:37:56 AM] The Stormfront Bullshit Filter",cbrim8,defaultmods_leaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/defaultmods_leaks/comments/cbrim8/ucordis_melum_april_24_2015_at_053756_am_the/,"We get a bunch of people on /r/history trying to start stupid shit (generally Holocaust denial, but sometimes other things). Since the Holocaust comes up like at least once every week, having to babysit those threads to find the racists is a huge chore and a pain in the fucking rear. 

So one day, I got super bored and super annoyed at the racists, and I wrote up an AutoModerator configuration to catch Holocaust deniers. This was my prototype Holocaust denier filter. Then I started looking at other shitty phrases, which lead me to create a white supremacist filter. Then I eventually just decided to combine the two into one general Stormfront filter, and here we are today.

Apparently [there is a need for one of these filters](https://www.reddit.com/r/defaultmods/comments/33k6ns/racebaiting_and_the_defaults/), and I already had one written... so today, I present to you the /r/history Stormfront bullshit filter (with a few edits from my initial comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/defaultmods/comments/33k6ns/racebaiting_and_the_defaults/cqm53z7)):

(This was also originally three filters, as I had one that silently removed phrases like ""check your privilege"" and ""go back to srs"", but then I figured that maybe mods would want to be notified of that stuff, so I just merged that one into the bigger remove and modmail rule.)

It's super easy to convert it into the new AM syntax, so I'm just posting it with the old AM syntax. Once everyone's converted to the new AM, I'll convert the copy I have on Github. 

I'll be making periodic updates as I find more phrases, so keep an eye out on the Github, since that'll have the most recent version of this config.

"Sarcasm, past comments and /history and /askhistorians",bze6g8,Oppression,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oppression/comments/bze6g8/sarcasm_past_comments_and_history_and/," 

Here is the background:

In this thread[https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bvcg3k/a\_life\_is\_not\_saved\_just\_by\_letting\_it\_be\_born/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bvcg3k/a_life_is_not_saved_just_by_letting_it_be_born/)

someone wrote that

""poverty is genocide in slow motion"".

Another redditor then replied that

""it‚Äôs way worse than genocide. Genocide means the suffering ends at some point in the future. It‚Äôs arguably much closer to slavery, which I could argue is a fate worse than death. ""

To which I wrote

""As a German, I say we did the Jews a favour. Some of them were not poor, but they could have been poor... "" Obviously, my comment was sarcastic and not to be taken at face value. I think anyone with reading comprehension can understand this.

I am currently reading Finkelstein's Holocaust Industry and I stumbled upon a passage that was not sourced as are most claims by Finkelstein. So I wrote this post in /history asking for a reference of this claim:

""I have a question about some paragraph in Finkelstein's Holocaust Industry. He writes that

Some years back, the parody of a New York tabloid was headlined: ‚ÄúMichael Jackson, 60 Million Others, Die in Nuclear Holocaust.‚Äù The letters page carried an irate protest by Elie Wiesel: ""How dare people refer to what happened yesterday as a Holocaust? There was only one Holocaust...""

My question: What publication was that? And was the letter by Wiesel itself a parody or a real letter written by him. Finkelstein provides footnotes for quite a lot of things, unfortunately, not for this one. ""

Once could rightly point out that I should have asked this question in /askhistorians but that is not why I was banned from /history. I was banned because:

Note from the moderators:

>Based on your comment history, we don't believe you are posting in good faith.  
As a German, I say we did the Jews a favour. Some of them were not poor, but they could have been poor...

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history) by replying to this message.

To which I replied:

""The post is obviously a sarcastic reply to the insane comment that poverty is worse than genocide. Do your job and read comments in their context. Even if my comment was meant as you read it, how would that have a bearing on my request for a source? Finkelstein has footnotes for many of his claims but not for this one, that is why I am interested. The way Finkelstein describes the situation, Elie Wiesel replied to a satire, something I have troubles believing.

Is it because Finkelstein is a contorversial figure? Is it because Finkelstein says that the suffering of Jews, although worse than most suffering, is not in an altogether separate category as other suffering? Be more specific when you ban people.

I am sorry to say that if my ban stays, you are not fit to be a moderator. Context very much matters and so does the ability to detect sarcasm. One last thing. Granted, you can ban whoever you want in your subreddit, but you would do better if you allowed free speech. Let the holocaust deniers come out and embarass themselves. The subreddit has enough subscribers that there would be sufficient pushback. It is not small enough for a claim like this to go unchallenged.""

Answer from the mods: tldr.

What is that? It is by no means clear what the problem is. I guess that they mistook my comment as endorsing the holocaust. As I wrote, even if that was my view that should not be a reason for banning. But it is their little playground. However, to answer my explanation with a simple ""tldr"" is rather disappointing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But it gets better. /askhistorians blocked me as well this time arguing explicitly that my question is in bad faith, because I made a sarcastic joke about the holocaust. Does it matter that it was a joke about comparing genocide to living in poverty? Nah. You have to be insane to understand my joke as something in the vicinity of holocaust denial.",6/11/2019 18:51,,,,,,

**The best arguments for major mainstream political positions:**

* * *

**Fascism and Neo-Conservatism** 

*On Dictatorship* and *The Concept of The Political* Carl Schmitt

Note:

>Some have argued that neoconservativism has been influenced by Schmitt Most notably the legal opinions offered by Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo et al. by invoking the unitary executive theory to justify highly controversial policies in the war on terror‚Äîsuch as introducing unlawful combatant status which purportedly would eliminate protection by the Geneva Conventions torture, NSA electronic surveillance program‚Äîmimic his writings.Professor David Luban said in 2011 that ""[a] Lexis search reveals five law review references to Schmitt between 1980 and 1990; 114 between 1990 and 2000; and 420 since 2000, with almost twice as many in the last five years as the previous five""

Zionists: Should the US return to Native Americans,pdmgey,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/pdmgey/zionists_should_the_us_return_to_native_americans/,"Native American tribes are the indigenous people of the Americas. White European settlers arrived systematically as early as the 15th century, creating colonies and eventually battling and defeating Native Americans. Today, Native Americans are a tiny minority, much of which lives in reservations tiny compared to how much land they inhabited previously.

Jews are indigenous to Judea. Several empires, such as the Roman empire, Islamic caliphates, and even the Crusaders, invaded Judea, creating colonies and expelling if not killing the native Jews. Today, Jews are the majority in the state of Israel, but they remain a tiny minority worldwide. However, they live in a country of theirs living on some of the land they previously inhabited.

Zionism advocates for the Jews to establish a state in their homeland: Palestine. Zionism was successful. It remains at the heart of Zionism that indigeneity matters the most when evaluating claims to land. Should this same treatment be given to Native Americans, so that the land they inhabited in the Americas (such as the United States) be given back to them?",8/29/2021 4:48,,,,,,

If youre a zionist do you see what IDF does to palestinians? Do you support it? Because I always see zionists either saying its deserved for certain reasons or ignoring it or always blaming hamas for everything.

It doesn't make sense to me. I see Israelis not support IDF for what they do and also see Palestinians not support hamas for what they do. And I hate seeing people justify the killings of palestinians because of hamas or hating palestinians for things israelis do as well

It was established as a political organization in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann.

So there is a lot of definitions but pretty much all of them are based on protecting the only jewish nation in the world. So here is my problem and the thing that makes me cringe, and it is when I see on the media things like:

""The Zionist government"" or ""The Zionist forces"" or even ""The Evil Zionist Empire"" that literally sounds like a childrens story about: ""that empire that wants to kill everyone"". 

So the point of this is to make people know, Zionism itself is not a crime, it means protecting the only country that is jewish in the world, because we know how the world treats jews and how is rising everytime, and if Israel just gets destroyed, all the jews around the world would be fucked, cause now they wouldn‚Äôt have power and people would use that to attack them.",7/23/2021 5:35,,,,,,

&#x200B;

Even if you assume they are acting in good faith and aren't just being anti-semites, both subs have specific rules regarding ""leftist unity"" which they themselves are clearly contradicting by banning labor/leftist/socialist Zionists, they are also acting completely counter-productively by alienating the very population (i.e. voting Israelis) which actually can make a change.

&#x200B;

I think this is a general pattern among leftist groups. More and more Zionists/Pro-Israel people/ Pro-Peace people are being attacked, which only causes further alienation among Israelis and pushes centrists to the soft right and the right to the ultra-right fascists.

Poll: American Jews are increasingly anti-Zionist,ojmqh3,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ojmqh3/poll_american_jews_are_increasingly_antizionist/,"[A recent poll by the Jewish Electorate Institute](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/a-quarter-of-u-s-jews-agree-that-israel-is-an-apartheid-state-in-new-survey-1.9995986) shows that American Jews, specially the younger generations, are becoming more critical of Israel. This data will certainly concern pro-Israel lobby organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and AIPAC, which equate anti-Zionism with antisemitism. While anti-Zionist Jews have essentially no political representation in Jewish establishment groups, it is now clear these organizations are facing a crisis of legitimacy with younger Jews who no longer view Israel a part of their identity. Considering how dependent Israel is on US support, these results also show the future of Zionism is in danger, since younger generations will not tolerate America's unconditional support for human rights abuses in Palestine.

The complete poll can be seen here: https://www.jewishelectorateinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/JEI-Survey-Analysis-071321.pdf

Some key findings:

* 41% of Jews under 64 feel no attachment to Israel
* 58% support restricting aid for Israel
* 62% support aid for Palestinians
* 61% believe the main cause of antisemitism is the right-wing
* 20% of Jews under 40 believe Israel doesn't have the right to exist
* 33% of Jews under 40 believe Israel is guilty of genocide against Palestinians
* 38% of Jews under 40, and 25% of all Jews, believe Israel is an Apartheid state
* 34% believe Israel's treatment of Palestinians is similar to the treatment of African Americans in the United States",7/13/2021 22:17,,,,,,

By the end of the first week, 14 June 1982, international red cross and Lebanese police figures claimed that 9,583 had died and 16,608 injured. By the end of the second week, they claimed up to 14,000 people died and 20,000 were injured, mostly civilians.

During the siege of Beirut, by late August 1982, Lebanese sources put the death toll in Beirut at 6,776. This figure included victims of the 4 June 1982, bombing, which occurred two days before the operation officially started. Lebanese police and international doctors serving in Beirut put the number of civilian casualties at about 80%. According to American military analyst Richard Gabriel, all factions in the conflicts agree that between 4,000 and 5,000 civilians died during the siege caused by military activity of all sides. He states that most of the observers that were present on the ground and other relevant sources in Lebanon agree that estimates of 8,000‚Äì10,000 are too high.

Accurate numbers of total casualties are hard to estimate, due to ""\[t\]he chaos of warfare, the destruction of city neighborhoods and refugee camps, the haste with which bodies were buried in mass graves and the absence of impartial agencies"". Many officials in Beirut, including those of the International Red Cross, claimed that the number of deaths were extremely difficult to estimate correctly. At least one official from a relief organization claimed that in the South about 80% of deaths were civilian and only 20% military.

In early September 1982, the independent Beirut newspaper *An Nahar* published an estimate of deaths from hospital and police records covering the period from 6 June to 31 August 1982. It claimed that 17,285 people were killed: 5,515 people, both military and civilian, in the Beirut area; and 2,513 civilians, as well as 9,797 military forces, including PLO and Syrians, outside of the Beirut area.

The Lebanese authorities gave a figure of 19,085 killed and 30,000 wounded with combatants accounting for 57% of the dead and civilians 43% in 1982. They do not include the estimated 800‚Äì3,500 killed in the Sabra and Shatila massacre.

Discussing with Zionists: they simply do not understand the concept of freedom,p2159s,Israel_Palestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/p2159s/discussing_with_zionists_they_simply_do_not/,"The typical response by Zionists in this board and others is that the Palestinians ""are not interested in peace"" and that they want ""to destroy the state of Israel"" and that they want ""to expel all Jews from Jordan river to the sea"".  It does not matter what one discusses, they would bypass virtually everything and go back to these points.  Many of them are probably agents of the state of Israel or belong to Zionist organizations and they have been schooled in this type of non-discussion.  Forget a debate, bring our points time and time again....and something will stick.

What is interesting is that the keep going back, time and time again, to the old Netanyahu point that ""the Palestinians are not interested in peace"".  But what exactly does ""interested in peace"" mean?  **The Palestinians are occupied by Israel, there is no state of war.**  The ""disturbances"" by the occassional Hamas firecrackers are minimal.  **Overall, there is a lot of ""peace"" in Palestine, but this peace is on Israeli terms and power**.  Israel is using this peace to increase its settlements, to add up to its annexations, to continue stealing the Jordan water and to oppress the Palestinians with massive jailings and army repression.  

**What the Palestinians want is freedom**.  **They are occupied for over half a century.  Two generations have been born and grew up in captivity**.  But this counts nothing for the Zionists, who just want the Palestinians to disappear (if possible).  If one mentions freedom, the Zionist jump to another subject.  Their favorite misdirection is to say that the Palestinians rejected Israeli ""offers"".  They know very well that these were not offers that would have allowed the Palestinians to have a viable, sovereign and independent state.  It would have been as state full of Israeli settlements (no better than Swiss cheese) the borders and airspace of which would have been patrolled by Israel, and a state with severely reduced sovereignty.  No self-respecting Palestinian would have signed on to these ""offers"" as they were just a minor restatement of the occupation.  

When one mentions any of this, the Zionists will again change the subject.  At this point, they have two main lines of defense.  One is that without the West Bank, Israel is indefensible (therefore, the West Bank has to be kept in perpetuity); the other is Gaza; they would say that Israeli evacuation of Gaza resulted in terrorist attacks from Gaza, therefore, nothing like that can be allowed to happen in the West Bank (therefore, the West Bank has to be kept in perpetuity).  

In Gaza, the Zionists just ""forget"" to mention that the conflict there is driven by Israel; Israel wants to defeat Hamas in order to cow the Palestinians into subservience.  It does not want to enter into any discussion with Hamas without Hamas accepting the Oslo accords (which have done not a thing for the Palestinians).  You will hear from the Zionists wails about the ""Hamas rockets"" and ""targeting civilians"" which is ironic because every day the Israelis kill people in Gaza with their blockade.  In 14 years, Hamas has killed and injured maybe a couple of dozen Israelis, but the Israelis have killed thousands (likely tens of thousands) in Gaza, where living is hellish.

**Nowhere in all that is the notion of freedom for a captive population of millions mentioned.**  The only freedom that is of any consideration is that of the Israelis.  No other freedom is at all under consideration.  **The ""peace"" that the Zionists refer to is their peace, their overall victory that the Palestinians are asked to undersign.**  Hopefully, the Palestinians never will.",8/11/2021 2:37,,,,,,

About a week ago he made a post titled ""Palestenian assassin kills Jordanian king"" and he linked the story of assassination of king Abdullah I, and he got so much downvotes on that post because it was clear what he was trying to do and he ended up deleting the post. 2 days later he posts again about Jordanian army killing people who were trying to enter invaded Palestenian land, yet again what he's trying to do is obvious and he got downvoted again and deleted the post.

I'm posting this now just to tell you all to be careful, this asshole is trying to pit Arabs against each other, I am a Jordanian I have lived most my life with Jordanians and Palestenians and there is no post that would make me hate Palestenians or even any Arab nationalities, we're all Arabs we should not allow assholes like this to divide us so it's easier for them to conquer.

One more thing to note, this behaviour is not coincidental, I'm willing to bet that the zionist IOF is behind this, they're probably scared of Jordan after the Jordanian stand at the borders during the last war, and they're strategy to counter this is to create hate between Palestinians and Jordanians.",8/2/2021 10:26,,,,,,

"Is ""Zionistic"" a real word?",pe8lvz,Israel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/pe8lvz/is_zionistic_a_real_word/,"Grumpy writer here browsing this subreddit in the early hours of the morning.

Somebody posted [a Jpost article ](https://www.jpost.com/jpost-tech/meet-the-hi-tech-olim-finding-job-success-677791)earlier about olim finding success in high tech. It contains the following passage:

*‚ÄúAliyah was always a goal for me,‚Äù says Lilly Liebman, 22, who made aliyah this summer from San Diego to Givat Shmuel. ‚Äú****My family is very Zionistic****. I came here for seminary, and I really enjoyed it. Aliyah was a goal I had, and I wanted to give it the best shot I could. I figured the best chance for me to come here and make everything work would be after college""*

This adjective (""Zionistic"") is something I've heart countless times from English speaking olim. I never heard this growing up so assumed it was an inaccuracy that had slipped into common use among American olim. Even Google is red-lining it¬†

What I do know: ""Zionist"" is the more common adjective used to describe somebody who espouses  or supports Zionist ideology. Therefore, I would have thought the correct way to write this sentence would have been *""my family is very Zionist""* or *""my family was very sympathetic towards Zionism.""* *However* upon closer inspection, [Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com) [lists](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/zionist) ""Zionistic"" as an accepted adjective under ""derived forms of Zionism"" here. The plot thickens.

**TL, DR:** Before giving out to the next person I encounter using it, I need the sub's help to confirm that Zionistic indeed isn't a real adjective. Also: we need to keep our adjectives straight.

Do we know anything about their plans? Are they interested in moving into emerging mixed towns like Nof HaGalil? Are they interested in moving into exclusively Arab towns like Nazereth, Rahat or Umm Al-Fahm?

How quickly is their movement growing?

"How can some Zionist modern orthodox people claim that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, but then at the same time desire and wish for a theocratic Israel where Halacha fully will govern the people",or7ta7,exjew,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/or7ta7/how_can_some_zionist_modern_orthodox_people_claim/,"That is pretty much the desire for the return of the Bet Ha Mikdash will entail the return of the Sanhedrins(Sanhedrin of 71 Judges and Sanhedrin of 23 judges placed in each town outside Jerusalem ) which can lash out the four death penalties and not forgetting the ◊û◊ú◊ß◊ï◊™ the 39 floggings for certain transgressions which do not require the death penalties and pretty much an Halachic state not really different to Daesh.

Majorly conflicted as a non-Zionist/Zionist Jew,nld2lg,IsraelPalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nld2lg/majorly_conflicted_as_a_nonzionistzionist_jew/,"I'm 100% Jewish. I have spent the last three years studying the conflict in great detail, devoting an entire year to it at the hebrew university of jerusalem. I've studied under Palestinian Arab, Palestinian Christian, Israeli Jewish, European Jewish, and European Christian professors. I spent the last week and a half nonstop trying to write about this conflict to submit something to my university paper but every time I finish a draft I feel like it both over and under sympathizes with both sides. To put it briefly: I'm torn.

I understand that antisemitism has defined Jewish existence for the past 2000+ years: our expulsion from the Middle East, persecution in Ethiopia, genocide in Germany and pogroms in Russia are only the most recent proof of this. I understand that the only way to secure Jewish protection is through a Jewish majority state with Jewish governance.

But nothing that I've learned has justified in my mind the occupation of 5 million Palestinians. The daily tortures and miseries they have gone through in the West Bank and Gaza since the 40s is too inhumane for words. And I can't justify the fact that we deny 13 million Palestinians their right of return. After Jews were expelled, 15 distinct empires controlled that area - the Palestinian people are the amalgam of residents left behind, and possess claims to the land nearly as ancient as ours. The idea that us jews have a right of return, but palestinians do not, seems criminal to me, like we're making palestinians pay the price of suffering that had nothing to do with them.

In my mind a Confederation solution would be ideal, where two independent states are created, their border dissolved into a dotted line and residents allowed to live in either territory. A third, joint government would handle things like security, resources, and the economy. But I feel like the existing hegemony between Israel and Palestine would not be fully dissolved as long as there existed two independent states, and as long as there is a hegemony there will be violence and oppression.

I don't know. I really don't know. I don't want to be considered a liberal brown-noser by my Jewish friends and I don't want my non-jew friends to call me a colonizer. I'm sick of feeling guilty for taking up space on social media to talk about antisemitism when all of this is going on, but I'm also sick of other Jews not talking enough about the crimes Israel is committing. I don't want to feel like I have to defend Israel's colonial practices (even if you don't think it was definitionally colonialism because we too are indigenous, our forced displacement of more than 1 million indigenous palestinians was objectively experienced as colonialism).

I don't know what to make of claims that Arabs and Jews simply can't live together. It seems so vile to assume that every Palestinian is a terrorist. And it seems so reductive and racist to believe that Palestinians are merely another extension of the 'Arab Kingdom'. But our ancestors were objectively all kicked out of every Arab country within the last half century. the last of yemen's jews were literally exiled last week. it doesn't feel like it's my place to tell the children of these refugees that arabs are all good and fine to live with. but it also seems like the region will never have peace if we don't coexist in a confederation-like or secular democratic state, and israel's war crimes will only increase.

I'm just, I hate this. I live in a house of leftist athiests, there's not a lot of room for sympathy for religious ethnostates that actively oppress an indigenous population. Does anyone else feel this way????? What happens now??

&#x200B;

edit: to those in the comments claiming that palestinians are not a people, or that I  have merely been victim to propaganda, that i'm uneducated: please stop. my hope with this post was to have civil discussions about solutions and to find other openminded people. I do not have the bandwidth nor energy to deal with dozens of people telling me that the jewish people have a superior claim to the land or that palestinian suffering isn't real. if that's how you feel, just keep scrolling",5/26/2021 12:49,,,,,,

My other grandpa went to Treblinka extermination camp, was one of 67 people who ever escaped. Over 700,000-900,000 people were murdered and he was one of 67 survivors. After he escaped, instead of running, he joined the Jewish resistance until the war was over. My other grandma went to Auschwitz Birkenau. She came with 8 siblings. They all were killed in front of her. Except for her twin sisters, who were taken and never seen again. She is the only one still alive. She‚Äôs very sick right now but I was able to convince her to talk about her time in the camps and answer any questions.

Nonetheless, the Nazis chose to allocate male and female prisoners to separate buildings, which puzzles me. 
If you turn people into administered objects that will be disposed, why would you care about their gender?

Two thoughts that I had:
- fear of reproduction is unlikely, because they also killed babies in the camp
- it is likely that separating families could break the morale and prevent uprisings

> Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said Poland would send someone else to Jerusalem as Poland&#039;s representative, but has not announced who will go.

> At the end of December, Putin addressed the nonaggression pact between Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin, in which Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union divided up Poland and other countries between themselves.

> Putin said Poland bore partial responsible for World War II, calling Jozef Lipski, Poland&#039;s ambassador to Germany until 1939, &quot;An anti-Semitic swine.""

> In 2018, Poland enacted its so-called Holocaust law, under which anyone who accuses &quot;The Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reich ... shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years.&quot; The law caused outrage in Israel.

> On the 73rd anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, while the law was still being discussed, the Israeli ambassador in Poland said it would make it impossible to tell the truth about the Holocaust.

VR opens up so many opportunities for us to explore moments in history from an emotional viewpoint rather than merely reading about it or watching a documentary.

Here's why, and how:",7k86mo,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7k86mo/jfk_and_his_brother_robert_were_killed_by_jewish/,"JFK was taken out by Jewish bankers and lobbyists overseeing gun runs to Cuba:

https://www.maryferrell.org/pages/Homer_Echevarria_-_Taking_Care_of_Kennedy.html

On November 21, 1963, a government informant named Thomas Mosley was negotiating the sale of machine guns to a Cuban exile named Echevarria Homer. Echevarria said that ‚Äúwe now have plenty of money ‚Äì our new backers are Jews‚Äù and would close the arms deal ‚Äúas soon as we [or they] take care of Kennedy.‚Äù The next day, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.

AGENCY: HSCA

RECORD NUMBER: 180-10065-10379

RECORD SERIES: NUMBERED FILES

AGENCY FILE NUMBER: 008894

INDIVIDUALS LISTED BY PROTECTIVE RESEARCH #59

Name of individual: ECHEVARRIA, HOMER S.

Reason for PRS interest: Nov. 1963, informant advised Chicago office that subject was member of anti-Casto Cuban group. Subject allegedly approached informant to provide machine guns for Cuban rev. 11/21/63 subject allegedly told informant **""We now have plenty of money -- our new backers are Jews -- as soon as 'we' or (they) take care of Kennedy...""** Subject expressed favorable attitude toward LBJ.

Degree of threat: 1 2 3

Organizations to which individual belongs: anti-Castro Cuban

Nationalistic group: Cuban

Date called to Secret Service attention: 11/26/63

Referred by other agency? NO YES

Action taken: Investigation by Chicago office did not disclose any violation under our jurisdiction and check-ups never initiated. Subject not interviewed.

Last location: Chicago, Il. '63

Field office: Chicago

Last UPD: 4/25/69

**JFK WAS KILLED ONE DAY LATER IN DALLAS**

Now, on to RFK.

RFK was openly against AIPAC and wanted to register informants from Israel as foreign agents.

""In the 1950s President Eisenhower's administration repeatedly demanded the leaders of the American Zionist Council register as ""agents of a foreign government.""[39] In November 1962 Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's Department of Justice ordered the American Zionist Council to register as a foreign agent because of FARA violations alleging it was being funded by the Jewish Agency for Israel and acting on behalf of Israel. The Department of Justice later withdrew its demand.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act

http://www.israellobby.org/azcdoj/

And it just so happens that RFK's killer was Palestinian born who couldn't even remember his name after the shooting. He still claims he was under mind control decades later, even after being denied bail.

"TIL that there was a Jewish Lobby in 1st century BC Rome, they exported Gold from the Roman provinces to Jerusalem, even Cicero was careful in confronting the jewish lobby in Rome.",2d1861,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2d1861/til_that_there_was_a_jewish_lobby_in_1st_century/,"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0019%3Atext%3DFlac.%3Achapter%3D28

>**The next thing is that charge about the Jewish gold. And this, forsooth, is the reason why this cause is pleaded near the steps of Aurelius. It is on account of this charge, O Laelius, that this place and that mob has been selected by you. You know how numerous that crowd is, how great is its unanimity, and of what weight it is in the popular assemblies. I will speak in a low voice, just so as to let the judges hear me. For men are not wanting who would be glad to excite that people against me and against every eminent man; and I will not assist them and enable them to do so more easily. [67] As gold, under pretence of being given to the Jews, was accustomed every year to be exported out of Italy and all the provinces to Jerusalem, Flaccus issued an edict establishing a law that it should not be lawful for gold to be exported out of Asia. And who is there, O judges, who cannot honestly praise this measure? The senate had often decided, and when I was consul it came to a most solemn resolution that gold ought not to be exported. But to resist this barbarous superstition were an act of dignity, to despise the multitude of Jews, which at times was most unruly in the assemblies in defence of the interests of the republic, was an act of the greatest wisdom. ‚ÄúBut Cnaeus Pompeius, after he had taken Jerusalem, though he was a conqueror, touched nothing which was in that temple.‚Äù [68] In the first place, he acted wisely, as he did in many other instances, in leaving no room for his detractors to say anything against him, in a city so prone to suspicion and to evil speaking. For I do not suppose that the religion of the Jews, our enemies, was any obstacle to that most illustrious general, but that he was hindered by his own modesty. Where then is the guilt? Since you nowhere impute any theft to us, since you approve of the edict, and confess that it was passed in due form, and did not deny that the gold was openly sought for and produced the facts of the case themselves show that the business was executed by the instrumentality of men of the highest character. There was a hundredweight of gold, more or less openly seized at Apamea, and weighed out in the forum at the feet of the praetor, by Sextus Caesius, a Roman knight, a most excellent and upright man; twenty pounds weight or a little more were seized at Laodicea, by Lucius Peducaeus, who is here in court, one of our judges; some was seized also at Adramyttium, by Cnaeus Domitius, the lieutenant, and a small quantity at Pergamus. [69] The amount of the gold is known; the gold is in the treasury; no theft is imputed to him; but it is attempted to render him unpopular. The speaker turns away from the judges, and addresses himself to the surrounding multitude. Each city, O Laelius, has its own peculiar religion we have ours. While Jerusalem was flourishing, and while the Jews were in a peaceful state, still the religious ceremonies and observances of that people were very much at variance with the splendour of this empire and the dignity of our name and the institutions of our ancestors. And they are the more odious to us now because that nation has shown by arms what were its feelings towards our supremacy. How dear it was to the immortal gods is proved by its having been defeated, by its revenues having been farmed out to our contractors, by its being reduced to a state of subjection.**",8/9/2014 4:11,,,,,,

[Event] Arrow Cross Party Issues Measure II,562f4v,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/562f4v/event_arrow_cross_party_issues_measure_ii/,"[WIP]

The second bill issued by the R.A.C.P.-Jobbik Coalition has been passed by the legislative. Focusing on internal development, Measure II aims to increase economic prosperity and cultural programs in Hungary.

**Border Safety Act**

> The Border Safety Act will institute a number of programs which will further increase the safety of our country, such as solidifying the budget allocations needed to build the border and redacting Hungary's involvement in the Schengen Area.

The Border Safety Act is a fairly straightforward piece of legislation. First, it withdraws Hungary from the Schengen Area, which has historically allowed for most citizens of countries within Europe to freely go from one country to the other. This is obviously a threat to national security, allowing terrorists and other subversives from other countries to gain easy entry into the country. Furthermore, the act approves earlier legislation to build a [border wall](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/55zcqs/event_hungary_closes_borders/) along the Northern border of Hungary. The final budget for the project is slated to be $3.25 billion and should be completed in roughly 4 months.

**National Broadcasting Act**

> To provide a non-biased and free news report, the government of Hungary will begin a radio and television broadcasting network.

Another straightforward bill, the National Broadcasting Act will form the Hungarian National Broadcasting Network, or the M.N.R.H. (Magyar Nemzeti R√°di√≥k√∂zvet√≠t√©s H√°l√≥zat). With free radio, television broadcasts, and associated social media accounts, it is hoped that the M.N.R.H. will increase voter empathy and enlighten the people of Hungary to political matters. [S] There will also, of course, be hints of propaganda in the diction - if the government wants something to be frowned upon, they'll use slight hints of negative connotations, and vice versa with positive matters. [/S] The M.N.R.H. will create around 500 new jobs, and the necessary infrastructural expansions and facilities will cost about $740,000,000, with the project being finished in about 5 months.

**National Internet Access Act**

> With the Internet and online media playing an ever-increasing role in modern politics, Hungarian citizens should have access to basic internet wherever they go.

Using the same towers as the M.N.R.H., the Hungarian government plans to enact nation-wide internet coverage. This coverage will be free, with higher Internet speeds being an optional payment included in one's income tax. All other internet providers will be asked to either combine with the National Internet Company or close down. This will cost $330,000,000 to create, and the necessary construction will take 2 months to complete.

**Military Acquisitions Act**

> In an effort to better prepare our soldiers for any conflicts, the Military Acquisitions Act will work to provide our professional and reserve armies with the most modern equipment available.

The Hungarian Armed Forces are sorely lacking in the area of modernized equipment. To this end, the Hungarian government puts out a bid for the following supplies:

* 150 main battle tanks (3-crew models)
* 75 cargo trucks (2-crew models)
* 200 armored personnel carriers (2-crew, 10-passenger models)
* 50 SAM systems (2-crew models)
* 50 howtizers (8-crew, 155mm models)
* 150 mortars (3-crew, 60mm models)
* assortment of smallarms (pistols, assault rifles, etc.) and surface-to-air missile launchers",10/6/2016 2:12,,,,,,

[Event] Arrow Cross Party Issues Measure I,557z7g,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/557z7g/event_arrow_cross_party_issues_measure_i/,"As part of their promises to the Hungarian people, the Arrow Cross-Jobbik Coalition has passed a bill known as Measure I - it is more a compilation of bills that are sandwiched together and passed as one entity.

**The National Safety and Security Act**

>In order to defend the sovereignty of Hungary, it is necessary to form more than a nominal defense force. A well-trained, well-funded military is essential to the integrity of our people.

Effects:

* The standing army of Hungary (Magyar Honv√©ds√©g/Hungarian Defense Force) will be brought to 30,000 personnel, composed of 25,000 infantry, 2,000 armor operators, 1,000 artillerymen, and 2,000 airmen.
* The mandatory conscription of all 18-year old males and female in the nation will be instituted. They will be placed in the Reserves (Tartal√©kok), bringing the number of reservists to 500,000. After two years, the reservists will either be allowed to discontinue their service or continue on in the professional military.
* A national police force of 10,000 will be established. Made of early-to-middle-aged former military personnel, the organization will be named the Hungarian National Police (Magyar Rend≈ërs√©g). They will be under the control of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of the Interior.

**Hungarian Historical and Cultural Preservation Act**

>Hungary has a long and proud history, with many unique cultural aspects stemming from such a proud lineage. It is because of this that we must work to protect our history and culture.

Effects:

* Hungary will ask Romania to set up Hungarian preservation areas, so that our artifacts will not be disturbed, and so that ethnic Hungarians can look at their heritage. 
* Many historical sites within Hungary will be granted a protective status. Vandalizing or otherwise damaging these sites is a crime punishable by death.
* To promote the continuation of cultural traditions, the government will offer free classes at community centers in such subjects as folk music, folk dancing, and traditional embroidery.
* The government will offer small subsidies to artists, musicians, writers, and poets who win a yearly competition that decides the most significant work in each of those fields.

**National Resettlement Act**

>Due to the inherent threat of Islamic extremism, it is an unfortunate necessity to relocate all Muslim residents of the nation. Furthermore, all Romani will be legally obligated to either settle down somewhere or be imprisoned.

Effects:

* All Muslims will be rounded up. Hungary will ask surrounding nations if they will take in these unfortunate souls.
* All Romani will be escorted by National Police, either to their settlement of choice or their prison facility.

**Prison Reform Act**

>It is not necessary or moral to coddle and pamper prisoners. In an effort to reform the prison system, the system will follow two basic goals - rehabilitation or service.

Effects:

* Criminals who commit non-violent crimes related to drug use will be put in prison-rehab centers, where they will treated for their addictions. Third-time offenders will be transferred to service centers.
* Criminals who commit non-violent crimes will be put in prison. These prisons will only cover basic necessities - they will not be comfortable, but they will offer reeducation classes, so that the inmates are qualified to reintegrate into society upon release.

[Event] Arrow Cross Party Issues Measure III,57tez5,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/57tez5/event_arrow_cross_party_issues_measure_iii/,"**Government Capitalism Act**

> In some countries, politicians reap wealth, owning palatial estates and huge stakes in stock. This, in turn, promotes corporatism and corruption. Hungary will not fall victim to such tricks.

The Hungarian government unanimously passes an act meant to limit government earnings and property. No member of government will be allowed to invest in stock or businesses, nor will any member of government be allowed to surpass more than $1,000,000 in personal possessions. 

**Civic Duty Act**

> Our students must know that serving in the government is not simply a ""job"", a mean by which money can be earned. Serving in the government is a mission of duty, a duty to one's country.

Following up on the previous act, students will be taught throughout their primary and secondary schooling that service in any form of the government - military, administrative, etc. - is serving the country as a whole. The purpose of this is to instill national pride and loyalty to the government over the private sector, where the main focus is making money.

**National Bus and Railway Act**

> All citizens of Hungary should have access to transportation. By providing taxpaying citizens with free access to buses and trains, inter-regional commerce may increase, along with a hopeful decrease in greenhouse emissions.

The Hungarian government, well aware of the dangers of global warming, has begun an initiative to provide the nation with free bus and railway travel. The goal of this is to increase commerce within the nation by allowing easier flow of travel from area to area and to reduce greenhouse emissions by lowering travel by individuals or smaller units by low-occupancy vehicles.

**Environmental Legacy Act**

> This planet is not only ours. Before us, it belonged to our ancestors, and after us, it will belong to our descendants. It is by that very same logic that we must all do our part to leave this planet in a better state than when we came into it.

Through the use of billboard ads and local pamphlet campaigns, the Hungarian government hopes to increase environmental awareness throughout the nation. In addition, tax breaks will be given to all citizens who successfully register any number of the following possessions:

* electric-diesel motor vehicles
* electric motor vehicles
* wind or solar generators that are shown to produce power

In addition, citizens who create surplus energy through green methods may sell it off to their local government, pending their municipality's approval.

**Revision of the National Safety and Security Act**

> Throughout these turbulent times, it is imperative that we maintain a force which can protect our nation. Already, 5,000 of our valiant men and women have shown their mettle in the Ukraine. Now, we must increase the size of our forces, that we may ensure our continued peace and prosperity.

The government will increase the size of the active military from 30,000 to 90,000 soldiers, and will also more actively acquisition military equipment. More information on the structure of these forces are upcoming, but training is expected to take 4-8 months, depending on branch and occupation.

**Service Member Tax Break Act**

> The Reserve Forces of our nation are young people, with the average age being 19. It is therefore our duty to give them some degree of financial assistance. By giving them a selection of tax breaks, these young folk will possess more fiances with which to support themselves and their families.

Simply put, all draftees in the Reserves will be given a tax break, to commend them for their service. In addition, all NCOs in the Reserves (which must reenlist) will be given a smaller tax break, to thank them for their training and leadership of the younger soldiers. Likewise, all forces in the active military will be given a tax break (the same rate as a Reserve NCO).

**Federal Aptitude Testing Act**

> The government must be a shining example of efficiency for the rest of our people. Therefore, we propose a test be given to all government employees, including military personnel, to ensure their loyalty.

The proposed test will consist of a general knowledge section, an interest inventory, and a personal history section. [S] There will also be a political section - any dissidents will not only be denied the position, but will be sent away to a political prison. [/S]

[S] **Establishing of the National Directory for Internal and Foreign Intelligence**

With the European Federation growing more bold each month, the Hungarian government has decided to ensure that the foreigners will not be able to influence our workings. To this effect, an intelligence service has been created, the National Directory for Internal and Foreign Intelligence, or NDIFI. Numbering at 2,500, the NDIFI will consist of the Foreign Intelligence Division and the Internal Intelligence Division. The Foreign Intelligence Division will number at 500 personnel. Out of these 500, 400 will be in the Foreign Surveillance Unit, responsible for monitoring foreign movements, with the other 100 being the Foreign Subterfuge Unit, engaging in sabotage and assassination. Meanwhile, the Internal Intelligence Division is split into three units. First, the Internal Surveillance Unit will number at 1,000 personnel, and will be responsible for monitoring the actions of the general populace. Next is the Internal Conduct Unit - with 250 personnel, this unit monitors government officials and ensures their loyalty. Finally, the Internal Policing Unit is responsible for the seizure and execution of any dissidents. Numbering at 750 personnel, the members of the IPU are trained along with military special forces units, and are highly skilled. All members of the NDIFI are under the direct authority of the Executive, and will take 7 months to train. [/S]",10/16/2016 23:27,,,,,,

Overview of the Hungary Rework as of 0.2 'Relighting the Powder Keg',lgfq6p,twrmod,https://www.reddit.com/r/twrmod/comments/lgfq6p/overview_of_the_hungary_rework_as_of_02/,"Took me a lot longer than I would have liked, but finally here is an overview of the Hungary Rework as of 0.2!

[Starting Situation](https://preview.redd.it/3pxzh1rhxig61.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=811d1ffd2d396c4ad11f2a1d9158a43f9f7f5aec)

Hungary is a nation of irony: It has a kingdom but no king, and led a Grand Admiral though it has no navy, and no cost line for that matter. The Hungary of 1952 is a snapshot of what it was in 1941. It's territory stretches from Northern Transylvania to the east, Prekmurje to the west, Novi Sad to the south, and Southern Slovakia to the North. It's steadfast Regent, **Mikl√≥s Horthy** has ruled Hungary since 1920, but looks to the time when he can retire, and allow his son and Deputy Istv√°n to take over.

All the while Hungary must manage it's internal factions between the more pro-German Radicals, the Military and it's loyalty, and lastly that of the Parliamentarians. The quest of the **Regent** and monarch, if there should be one at all, must also be answered, or pushed off once again to a later date.

# Croatian War

[Croatian War](https://preview.redd.it/3cbxct6oxig61.png?width=2848&format=png&auto=webp&s=2722f3e060c1ecd5cd05223e156fc34bb34b2179)

The first major battle Hungary could face is the escalation of the border war with Croatia. Croatia instigates a border war under the guise of helping their fellow Croatian in the Hungarian lands in the state of Novi Sad.

If successfully defended, Hungary will take control of the Croatian state of Srem. If unsuccessful, Croatia will take Novi Sad.

The looser of each situation has the option of declaring war to reclaim the now lost state, or leaving it be. This actual war can end a number of ways: It Hungary is able to hold back Croatia, Srem will be given back; a complete Hungarian victory will see Croatia split with the newly created Bosnia along historic Hungarian claims; If Croatia won the first time and is able to hold off Hungary, it will keep Novi Sad; a complete Croatian victory will see Hungary puppeted by the ruling Croatian Usta≈°a.

# Romanian War

[Romanian War](https://preview.redd.it/bjne0p9qxig61.png?width=2658&format=png&auto=webp&s=a42bdd886a4952690a89b93711cb378c5f783e0e)

Possible occurring concurrently with the Croatia border war, the largest and most significant challenge  to Hungary will be the Second Hungarian-Romanian War. Romania, keen to reclaim Northern Transylvania, will declare war on Hungary. Like the war with Croatia, it can end a number of ways.

Hungary can hold back the Romanians, leading to a status quo ante, with no border changes.

Hungary can push far enough into Romania, taking the Transylvanian lands, will force the Romanians to the table. If they agree to a deal, it will end with the pre-war borders. This is the same situation if Hungary holds off Romania for 200 days while the timer counts down. If Romania declines the deal, and Hungary takes Bucharest, Romania will submit and Hungary will return to it's pre-WWI borders.

Likewise if Romania pushes far enough into Hungary, taking the Transylvanian lands, will force the Hungarians to the table. They can take a deal which would see Hungary return to it's pre-WWII borders. Southern Slovakia and Alf√∂ld will become DMZs, while Carpatho-Ukraine gains it's independence.

Romania can take the state of Alf√∂ld while granting Southern Slovakia to Slovakia or letting Hungary keep it, albeit as a DMZ, and the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine, with an option to make King Michael the Duke. This peace deal would see Hungary as a puppet. Or Hungary will be allowed to keep Alf√∂ld, with the addition that the monarchy question will be settled once and for all: King Michael of Romania will be proclaimed King of Hungary as well.

# After Romania - Victory

[Monarch Question](https://preview.redd.it/21qbhwkrxig61.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e48266f2ffe5b7c7480953996acd161847461f3)

Let us assume for a moment that Horthy was victorious against the Romanians and the internal factions of Hungary are in check. Coming off this high, Horthy will announce his intention to step down as Regent to be replaced by his son, **Istv√°n Horthy**. Whether the issue of the monarchy was decided or not, this is the time. 

If it was decided not long after the beginning of the game:

* End the monarchy and install the younger **Horthy** as President (herby just Horthy) of a Hungarian Republic
* Invite the Italian choice, **Filiberto di Savoia-Genova**, the Duke of Genoa, to become King
* Invite the heir of deposed King Charles IV/IV. K√°roly, **Otto von Habsburg**, to return from exile in America to become King.
   * In this case Horthy will be elevated to the new position of High Minister, above the PM.

If it was put off to after Istv√°n Horthy takes over:

* End the monarchy and install the **Horthy** as President of a Hungarian Republic
* Invite the heir of deposed King Charles IV/IV. K√°roly, **Otto von Habsburg**, to return from exile in America to become King.
   * In this case Horthy will be elevated to the new position of High Minister, above the PM.
* Continue with the Regency, status quo.

[Election Parties](https://preview.redd.it/s2i5waqvxig61.png?width=2088&format=png&auto=webp&s=34f058f12bfc15a7b9268570293767adca8b7377)

[Istv√°n Horthy Tree \(Left and Center\) - Democracy Tree \(Right\)](https://preview.redd.it/3kis9fiwxig61.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b8c751d0003fce1424bb2df7443e53fab860562)

\-If Filiberto became King or the Regency was kept, this will set Hungary down the Autocracy route, with only faux elections held. In the succeeding tree, the 'The Modest Autocracy' focus will bypass and open up the shared Autocracy tree.

\-If Otto became King or Horthy President, a Constitutional Convention will be held and determine which type of democracy Hungary shall have: an autocracy or an actual democracy.

The events differ slightly if Otto is King or Horthy President, but during the Convention, a Grand Coalition forms/Otto seeks to influence the government (not openly though). If Horthy partnered with all the friendly right-wing parties and got them to coalesce around him, or King Otto was sidelined, it will Horthy will come out on top and form the **EDP**, the United Democratic Party, and go down the Autocracy route, with only faux elections held. In the succeeding tree, the 'Victory for the EDP' focus will bypass and open up the shared Autocracy tree.

Instead if Horthy allowed free and fair elections or if King Otto's advise is taken, this will bring Hungary down it's Democracy route, holding a real election. But before that can happen Horthy must decide if he himself will run. If he does, he will transform his party into the **NEP**, National Forward Party.

In the elections that follow, if Horthy ran and won, in the succeeding tree, the 'Victory for the NEP' will bypass and open up the shared Autocracy tree. If any other of the parties that can be elected; the social conservative **FKgP**, the social liberal **PDP**; or the social democrat **MSZDP**, it will bypass their victory focus in the shared Democracy tree. (Though I don't know what happens to Horthy and his High Minister position in the event he and his party loose the election, or choose not to run at all.)

[Dunapentele ](https://preview.redd.it/092tm6edyig61.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=61330f073e293b72db32ed829052c0988873ad2f)

In the Autocracy route, Horthy will seek to emulate the US, where he had spent some time, industrializing and bringing Hungary to up par with other world powers. He takes a small village and transforms it into a brand new industrial city Dunapentele (""Pantaleon up on the Danube""), named after Saint Pantaleon. Through various decisions it can be built up and expanded, including it's victory point measure. Being a former fighter pilot, he also creates Magyar Airlines, a one day possible competitor to Lufthansa. Horthy wants Hungary to go into the next century as a regional powerhouse, one whose neighbors can look to for success.

# After Romania - Defeat

In the event that Horthy is defeated by Romania, the country will go into a crisis, with the Parliamentarians and the fascist Arrow Cross Party fighting it out. It is an event choice on which will come out on top.

**Arrow Cross**

[Arrow Cross](https://preview.redd.it/xchhjeweyig61.png?width=2812&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c68d233b3ced4302f30d58d2e67f2cc963ab26)

If the Arrow Cross under **Ferenc Sz√°lasi** came out victorious, they will first get to go down the 'Chang in Direction' tree, and then the 'Great Humiliation' tree. The new government will build itself up for a reclamation of the lost Hungarian territories. Also in this path, the Horthys are arrested and can either be jailed or killed. (The bottom left box is if the Party came to power before the defeat by Romania, see a bit blow for more info.)

[NS Coup and Counter-Coup](https://preview.redd.it/fmbza78pyig61.png?width=2287&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a20b390cd73ab9eba5dbc749a52652a215f6c0)

When 'The German Question' focus is taken, the Arrow Cross government will have to decide what to do about German collaboration. It can end it, keep it, or with the correct conditions (of which I still can not say what) the National Socialists under **L√°szl√≥ Baky** will coup the government and take over. Later on if the government was couped, **Zolt√°n B√∂sz√∂rm√©ny**, if allowed back in the country just after game start, will conduct his own coup and install his Strasserite Scythe Cross Party.

**Parliamentarians**

[Democracy - Held](https://preview.redd.it/ycipej3ryig61.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fb84df4ece476ada78ba23427723ba81e6bef09)

If the parliamentarians came out victorious, the country will be declared a republic and led by social democrat MSZDP and it's leader **√Årp√°d Szakasits.** After taking power, the MSZDP will have which way to steer the country, to immediate democratic elections or to delay them ~~indefinitely.~~ Note that if having elections, while the candidates are the same as they are under Istv√°n Horthy's democracy, unlike that situation the ones elected here have no content.

[Democracy - Delayed](https://preview.redd.it/2rjs6dltyig61.png?width=2814&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e59c11fd693ea451aa64243bd9dcdec175b61cf)

To combat nationalism, the MSZDP can call off elections and assume emergency control. But radicals in the government will start to stirrup trouble and will come to a head at the People's Congress. The current government can win out in the election of a General-Secretary of the Congress, or the radicals can pull out a win. The latter will see the **Ferenc Erdei** of the socialist NPP taking over.

# Non-Horthy Paths

**Military**

[Military Govt.](https://preview.redd.it/8zouhjzuyig61.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=f70463654e599aeeaa589115e21c7c02fe3fb57e)

Suppose for a moment that Mikl√≥s Horthy was not able to keep the the military in check before the Romanian War. **G√©za Lakatos** and fellow members of the military will coup Horthy and take control. *I believe that the 'Change in Direction' focus is supposed to bypass with the coup but it never did.* Lakatos will appoint a new Regent in Baron born **Vilmos Apor.**

If the government fails in it's Romanian War, Parliamentarians will rise up and declare a Republic,

If the government succeeded in the war, the permanent military government will either seek closer cooperation with Italy or (if denied, or instead), Hungary will work to become the Sweden of the Balkans, a neutral powerhouse.

**Arrow Path**

If before the war with Romania, Radical influence rises to 100%, the Arrow Party will coup the Horthys. You can see this path above under the After Romania - Defeat. But unique with the Arrow Party is that whether in victory or defeat against Romania, the fascist government will not be ousted. It is just which side of the tree is unlocked. A victory will see the Kingdom turned into the Greater Hungarian State.

# Third Hungarian-Romanian War

The Third War can be instigated by either looser. If it was by Hungary, Hungary will have to remilitarize first, in violation of the treaty with Romania (named by Romania as the Treaty of Brasov).

No matter who starts the war, it ends when one country capitulates. If Hungary wins, Romania will be balkanized, while if Romania wins, it will be similar to a complete Romanian victory in the Second War.

The top left you will see a socialist Hungary's victory; the middle a victory of a democratic/Military Coup/Autocracy Hungary; on the right you will see an Arrow Cross Hungary's victory.

On the bottom left you will see Hungary if it lost to a Legionnaire Romania, while the right is to a royalist/democratic Romania.

**Bug:**

There was one little bug I wanted to point out: The Decision to core the new Hungarian Lands, under Hungarian Expansion, when you take 'Establish Control in Upper Hungary, it gives cores on the Northern Urals and Western Slovakia, instead of Eastern and Western Slovakia. Thought it was kind of funny so wanted to being it up lol

Hope you liked it, and hope you are enjoying the reworked nations as well! As always please let me know if anything looks amiss. These reworks bring a lot of content but I am pretty sure I got all of it.

Thank you!

* Mon is 3 gingko leaves, a reference to their influence in Ariake.
* First lords were known as ‚Äúthe great builders‚Äù, since they constructed the Golden Temple of Ariake, and all of the lighthouses across Tsushima. Lord Adachi also helped Lord Shimura improve Castle Shimura‚Äôs fortifications.
* Were also skilled at destroying structures, which assisted the suppression of the Yarikawa Rebellion.
* Supposedly had a long-standing rivalry with clan Kikuchi which the wedding of Ikeda Kikuchi with Hana Adachi was meant to pacify, but this eventually led to disastrous consequences

# Clan Nagao

* Mon is the fletching of 2 arrows, crossed.
* Known for producing incredibly skilled archers, and trains their warriors in ky≈´d≈ç, the way of the bow, since they are old enough to walk.
* The most famous archer produced by clan Nagao was Tadayori Nagao. As the legends goes, Hachiman, the kami of archery and war, was so impressed by Tadayori‚Äôs skill, he gifted him his own armor. While Tadayori wore this mythical armor, he was able to single handedly defeat the pirates who threatened Azamo Bay.
* Sensei Ishikawa was also a member of clan Nagao. He once taught ky≈´d≈ç to Hironori Nagao, a fellow member of his clan, but Hironori ended up using the skill to start an internal rebellion in an attempt to hijack the clan. His rebellion was soon crushed, but not before he was able to kill many of clan Nagao‚Äôs finest warriors. As a result of this, he was executed. The clan fabricated a story in which Hironori was killed while fighting bandits in order to preserve the clan‚Äôs legacy. Ishikawa was blamed for Hironori‚Äôs treachery, but was allowed to bow out from his service to clan Nagao peacefully.
* Hirotsune Nagao, the last lord of clan Nagao, and the majority of the clan was killed at the Battle of Komoda.

# Clan Yarikawa

* Mon is 4 green leaves
* Known for producing incredibly skilled sword fighters, the ‚ÄòDance of Wrath‚Äô technique was a skill passed down among generations of the lords of Yarikawa. When Tokiasa Yarikawa became lord of Yarikawa and mastered the Dance of Wrath, he became resentful of clan Shimura‚Äôs control over Yarikawa, and started the Yarikawa Rebellion to overthrow clan Shimura‚Äôs hold. The rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, and was suppressed by clans Shimura and Sakai, and Tokiasa was executed.
* According to the legend, before Tokiasa was killed, he swore vengeance against his enemies beyond his grave. Since then, people from Old Yarikawa would leave offerings to Tokiasa‚Äôs spirit in hopes of their enemies being eliminated, and the Spirit of Yarikawa‚Äôs Vengeance would respond to their offerings.
* Their reputation as traitors still remains, but they still assisted clan Shimura in repelling the Mongols.

# Clan Shimura

* Mon is a rising sun over fields.
* Secondary symbol is the pampas grass fields, as featured in the armor and katana
* Serenity was among their most prized virtues, the core of their establishment which guided all actions of leadership
* Was once a small family of warriors that owned no land, and served Lord Kugewara, and helped him defeat the Heisuke Outlaws who ruled most of Tsushima at that time. All of Kugewara‚Äôs sons died in that conflict, so he arranged for Tokiasa Shimura to marry his only daughter. Once Kugewara died, all of his holdings became clan Shimura‚Äôs, leading to them becoming the dominant clan on Tsushima.
* Favored clan Sakai just as Lord Kugewara once favored clan Shimura. Lord Kazumasa Sakai married one of the daughters of clan Shimura, and later became close friends with his brother-in-law Lord Shimura
* Reduced to a single individual after the Yarikawa Rebellion when the former jito and rest of family was massacred by clan Yarikawa

# Clan Kikuchi

* Mon ‚Äú...*symbolizes the mighty Winter lords.*‚Äù -Jin
* Clan Kikuchi was once very close, if not one, with Yarikawa before breaking ties and moving north to Kamiagata.
* Known to keep to themselves at clan gatherings, but when they didn‚Äôt, there was usually an argument that ended with a duel.
* Even though Kikuchi‚Äôs warriors took comfort in the cold and dark of Kamiagata which made them harsh and stubborn, they joined the call to gather at Komoda to help fight the Mongols.
* After the death of her husband, Ikeda Kikuchi, and the rest of the clan on Komoda Beach, his wife, Hana, took the opportunity to hijack clan Kikuchi and its holdings for her own, through a series of events. The new mon of the clan consists of a large gingko leaf surrounded by 2 other smaller gingko leaves, seemingly inspired by clan Adachi‚Äôs mon, which her past is connected to.

# Clan Sakai

* Mon is twin mountains
* Known for being able to ‚Äúrise from the ashes‚Äù, so presumably, disaster has struck the Sakai clan before, but they have been able to recover and become stronger.
* There have been at least 7 generations of clan Sakai
* ‚ÄòThe Storm of Clan Sakai‚Äô blade is popular amongst the people of Tsushima, and is regarded as extremely high quality, which has been passed down amongst the generations of clan Sakai.
* Kazumasa Sakai, the former head of clan Sakai, was revered to be a terrifying warrior, who was not only able to scare enemies on the battlefield, but even frightened his allies alike. This characteristic was common among heads of the Sakai clan.
* Kazumasa was also in opposition to Lord Shimura‚Äôs rigid code, which is a position that his son, Jin, also comes to hold.
* Is officially disbanded by the Shogun after Jin, the last surviving member, was declared a traitor.",4/25/2021 5:15,,,,,,

Geela lay flat on her back, much how she had all day. This was hell. Morrissey had pretended not to notice for a few hours, opting to nap instead. But as the sun came up, he‚Äôd asked Geela tentatively when they could expect to move on to Terha‚Äôs castle.

\~\~\~

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me. Just‚Ä¶ never talk to me. Ever again. Or I‚Äôll fry you.‚Äù She hates how pathetic she looks but the moment her feet came in contact with the ground, she‚Äôd pitched left, then right, and then splatted on her face. It had taken enough strength to roll to her back. She‚Äôs not standing up right now.*

*Morris hems and haws before suggesting they get breakfast.*

*It‚Äôs not exactly a good suggestion but Geela jumps on it, anything to get the reformed pirate out of her hair. She‚Äôs generous enough to not fry him, even a little bit.*

*He‚Äôs gone several hours before Geela realizes he must have abandoned her. It takes her another hour to muster up the willpower to care and another hour to finally make it to her feet. She plants her boots in the soft, squishy sand, clutching a nearby tree for support. Now just to find that‚Äî*

*‚ÄúOh, Captain! You‚Äôre upright!‚Äù*

*The sudden voice makes Geela jump and fall over again. Morris has reappeared with a crate of food.*

*‚ÄúGot us some bananas and sea turtle sandwiches. Wanted those pineapple and coconut drinks but apparently, they‚Äôve been out of coconuts for a couple years.‚Äù*

*Geela‚Äôs face is one of murder but she doesn‚Äôt turn down the sandwich as Morris prattles on.*

*‚ÄúSomething to do with crippling the economy is the theory. Terha ordered the coconut trees all burned. Shop woman said she could fix me up with just a pineapple beverage, but that‚Äôs not quite right, is it? It‚Äôs just frothy pineapple juice or whatever, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like my pineapple juice and I do enjoy some froth, but there‚Äôs just something missing without the‚Äî‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI promise; there are easier ways to die than this,‚Äù Geela finally says. ‚ÄúLess painful, too. You could swim into a forest of piranhas or disturb a giant crab. I promise, both of those would be far less agonizing than what I‚Äôll do to you if you don‚Äôt immediately shut up.‚Äù*

*He shuts up and stays that way for the rest of the day. Geela practices walking six times, supporting her weight on the silent pirate. The fourth time, she starts to get the hang of it, and by the sixth time, she‚Äôs practically a pro. Satisfied, she flops back in the sand to waste away the rest of the day.*

\~\~\~

It hadn‚Äôt been a waste, however. The infiltration would happen at night. *The Sciliatia* had drifted ominously closer to shore but not enough for the port‚Äôs guns to fire on her. Geela already had the sneaking suspicion that Terha wasn‚Äôt on this island. It was too undefended, and really, the pirate queen wouldn‚Äôt likely be hiding in the castle closest to where Geela had sailed from.

Still, she had to torch the palace. It would weaken the mask on the castles and send a message.

Just as the sun kissed the horizon, Geela sat bolt upright.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù she said, climbing to her feet. They shook a bit but held. Could be worse. Could be better but always could be worse.

The pair traversed through the thick, jungly vegetation that surrounded the first of Terha‚Äôs estates. Morris practically carried Geela through some of the more ridiculously tricky terrain, all while the two peeled their eyes for signs that they were approaching the place.

This castle, according to one of Geela‚Äôs captives, Tinny, wasn‚Äôt particularly tall but it was sprawling and sunsoaked. Six huge, spacious bedrooms, three-and-a-half washrooms, modern kitchens with black granite fireplaces and new iron spit-set, updated dining hall with all marble floors and polished crystal chandeliers! Four well-maintained courtyards allow for seamless indoor outdoor transitions, perfect for entertaining guests or sleeping under the starry skies. Enjoy peaceful evenings in your castle, guarded well by up-to-date security systems, including guards, walls, and a network of traps and curses that will keep your nights restful. This hidden gem is not to be missed! 

It was these, well-pitched courtyards that Geela would be taking advantage of for her breakin. According to the prisoners that didn‚Äôt moonlight as a real estate agent, the traps in this castle had a couple weakspots, which had been painstakingly extracted from the void pirates. That little torture session had been the best part of this entire ridiculous mission. Ultimately, Morris had convinced them to give up their well-guarded secrets, putting an end to Geela‚Äôs fun and her growing finger collection.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù the pirate traitor said, motioning Geela to creep further forward. ‚ÄúCan you see the walls through the trees?‚Äù

Geela took another step forward and winced as her boot sank into a goopy green mud puddle. It wasn‚Äôt a particularly beloved boot, but it was an important one: springy shoes, an old toy she loved as a child, updated and improved for her needs. She scratched at her face, brushing some bug carcasses off her. The hood had a few threads of electricity woven in to kill any insects that landed on her, but it didn‚Äôt spare her the task of removing the bodies. Underneath her hood, the orange hairbow that kept her body knit together, should she take any spills, bunched up her hair. She‚Äôd spent a good amount of time trying to transfer the enchantment from the bow to something else more‚Ä¶ dignified, but unfortunately the enchantment was rooted too deeply in the disgusting fabric, and Geela had yet to produce another artifact that worked *quite* as well. There were components she lacked from the Farmlands, so until she managed to make it home, she‚Äôd have to deal with the bow.

Right now it stuck miserably between her hair, hood, and sweaty neck. Everything here sucked and she couldn‚Äôt wait to get over those walls and into the castle. Anything to get out of it again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to trigger the alert on the southeast side,‚Äù Morris said, speaking out loud the plan Geela had already told him and already knew. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the weakest of the wards, so the alerts are actually on a hairpin trigger. Indiscriminate. Tripped often by wildlife, the guards will respond to it slowest.‚Äù

This was literally Geela‚Äôs own plan, word for word, parroted back. She restrained the urge to punch him, since he was her ride back home, and instead grit her teeth and inhaled through them.

‚ÄúOnce I‚Äôm through, I‚Äôm actually going to run back,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when we make our way to the north end. According to the guard schedules, the guards that spent the evening shift in the north end are the ones to respond to alerts in the south end. This is to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMorris.‚Äù

‚ÄúCaptain.‚Äù

They stared each other down for a second before Morris swallowed hard.

‚ÄúYes, Captain.‚Äù

With this, he was off. Geela watched him through her spyglass, throwing rocks at the walls from his position crouched behind a mossy log. It took about half a dozen before Geela felt a whine flutter off to the far end of the castle. She started counting in her head as Morris scurried back to her, and the two started north, creeping through the underbrush. It wasn‚Äôt terribly hard to move inconspicuously, not because the jungle was lacking in dense foliage but because there was so much wildlife that their noises were easily covered.

Once they reached the north end entrance to the castle, Geela pressed a field distorter into Morris‚Äôs palm. He didn‚Äôt wait for another signal and instead began hoofing it for the small service entrance to the side. Once triggered, the field distorter would force any nuance detectors within the castle to reset. Anyone inside the castle at this time would be registered as ‚Äònormal‚Äô and wouldn‚Äôt trigger most of the traps.

Geela rose to her feet as soon as she saw Morris make it through the service entrance and began walking carefully towards the main gate. She reached out with her magic sensing, feeling for the reset in the shield around the main entrances, the one currently sending shockwaves of annoying, whiny alerts around the entire castle. The guards would, surely, be reaching the location of Morris‚Äôs first disturbance. She‚Äôd have about eight seconds for the entire field to be corrected, during which time the resetting alarm was still active but most inputs were ignored.

She hovered by the door, waiting‚Ä¶

Just when she thought she couldn‚Äôt wait another moment, the whine shuddered and began flickering. Without another thought, she slipped a simple lockpick into the knob and pushed the door open. As she breached the maingate, she felt the whine grumble and complain at her invasion, but before it could raise enough hell to rouse the guards, it reset fully, with no one the wiser at Geela‚Äôs entrance.

She closed the door tightly behind her, relocking it, for posterity's sake. After that, she stood stock-still, waiting for the report that Morris had reset the nuance detectors. It would, presumably, be just like Terha to put deadly traps right by the entrance for anyone whose scent the detectors didn‚Äôt already know. Presumably, because Geela didn‚Äôt know smack about the woman other than her pretentiously worded letters, but she also wasn‚Äôt about to test the queen‚Äôs compassion.

Another second past before a wet, snuffly feeling brushed over her. Eurgh. Terha‚Äôs detection spell was based around a hybrid of physiological and psychic magic, looking at the person from a personality and physical point of view, versus identifying their souls or spirits. It was fine and all, but Geela was left with the impression that she‚Äôd just been thoroughly sniffed by a large, friendly dog. She may have been a dog person, but that didn‚Äôt mean she liked having her personal space invaded.

Anyhow, Terha‚Äôs little ‚Äòwatchdog‚Äô seemed satisfied that Geela should be there and passed over her, giving her the freedom to roam the place without triggering unseen, magical traps. Physical traps or guards, that would be different, but that‚Äôs what the stealth garb was for. She just had to cross her fingers that she wouldn‚Äôt need to demonstrate her complete lack of dexterity anytime soon. Morris was locked outside the castle now and would spend the rest of the mission as a lookout for anyone entering or exiting the place.

As for Geela, she was on her own now.

When the prisoners had explained the castle to her and Darkos, Darkos had stared at them, utterly befuddled by the maze of rooms, corridors, passageways, and staircase that they‚Äôd tried to verbally describe. It was okay, really it was. Most people lacked Geela‚Äôs ability to picture almost anything described to her and almost everyone lacked her ability to commit this new mental image entirely to memory. Without the ability to picture and store anything she needed, she would never have gotten this far. Her inability to cast on the fly meant every attack she launched had to be perfectly mapped out in her head before she could start. To the average spectator, usually a soon-to-be victim, this appeared as though Geela was omnipotent and omniscient, which was exactly how she liked it.

Now this knowledge gave her the distinct advantage of being able to avoid spectators, as she tripped through the castle, bumbling through blindspots and fumbling her way through locked doors and halls. With the toll wreaked on her balance by the damned sea-to-earth transfer, she needed as few eyes witnessing her clumsiness as possible.

Fortunately, the castle wasn‚Äôt very inhabited. This was probably what the average Terha castle looked like. Opulently decorated, swarming with guards, but otherwise empty. Who else was going to live here? It‚Äôs not like she had friends and as far as Geela knew, her brother lived mostly on the water and her mortal sister‚Ä¶

Geela wasn‚Äôt actually sure but it was on her docket to find out.

As she trundled through the palace, she placed little devices throughout the castle, winding her way through the lower levels, finding the thickest, most load-bearing columns and decking them out with the plasma blaze changes. This was going to be lovely when it all went up.

Terha had combined two of the huge, spacious bedrooms into her personal chambers and attached study. Geela would have to take a peek in there, see what she could find, and pray that there weren‚Äôt more letters in there about her sex life.

She skittered to a halt in front of large, white marble doors. Yes, marble doors. Terha either needed to hire an interior decorator or murder her current one. The doors were also surrounded by an absurd number of sharp, jagged daggers, precariously positioned on all sides, and every single one of them pointing towards the center of the door. Probably a trap and an incredibly gaudy one. Judging by the tight wires twining between each dagger, it might actually be one triggered by a physical stimulus.

Touching the door was potentially a death trap. On closer inspection, the cold marble bore no fingerprints, which led credence to Geela‚Äôs theory. Either Terha never used the room, had it meticulously cleaned, or no one ever touched.

Time to run a test. Geela studied the doors closely, taking in the crevices in the polished marble before wiggling her fingers and creating an illusion that the door was ajar and the daggers‚Ä¶ well she didn‚Äôt know quite what the trap would look like when sprung but she imagined some of the daggers might be scattered across the floor, so she tossed some around the ground for good measure. Finally, to really sell it, she created the illusion of a trail of blood leading into the chambers.

Satisfied after a few tweaks, she triggered her own, jerry-rigged trap, with a loud, pained scream. Something that might sound like someone getting stabbed by a ton of daggers. She slipped behind a large column, one keeping her in plenty of shadow, and peered around the corner, hoping someone had heard her.

Terha‚Äôs guards were no slobs and within a few moments, she heard footsteps.

‚ÄúThere, the study‚Äôs tripped, I told you someone got in,‚Äù one said, panting slightly.

‚ÄúIntruder or servant though?‚Äù the other guard had a pensive look on her face. ‚ÄúThere was an alarm earlier, down at the southeast gate‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou run down that way, ask the guards if they found anything. I‚Äôm going to peek inside the study. If I recognize one of the daft heads from the kitchens‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, a wicked grin on his face indicating great joy at the idea of said ‚Äòdaft heads‚Äô meeting a grisly fate for trying to enter Terha‚Äôs study.

The female guard nodded and hoofed it down the hallway. According to Geela‚Äôs mental blueprints, it‚Äôd probably take her at least fifteen minutes to reach the southern gate. More than enough time for Geela to finish with the study.

And speaking of the study, the remaining guard approached the 'cracked' doors cautiously, putting out a hand to push the ajar door open.

His hand made contact with the door a few inches before it should have. The man probably had about an eighth of a second to wonder why the door appeared to be open but his hand had felt cold marble where there was seemingly only empty space.

Then the still-very-armed trap triggered and hoo boy was it an ugly one.

Geela dropped her illusion, enjoying the show. After the pinging and thunking of knives ended, Geela waited a few extra seconds to make sure the daggers had all fully released. Many had missed their target but enough had made their mark to assure that Geela was, once again, alone in the hall.

For extra good measure, Geela entertained herself with pelting the body parts at the door to make sure no further traps were triggered. Then for extra extra good measure, Geela fastened one of the guard‚Äôs hands to his spear and used it to push open the blood-stained marble doors. Another ping ping sounded as a handful of flaming arrows crossed the doorway, one making contact with Geela‚Äôs spear. The spear didn‚Äôt really take to the fire much, fortunately, and after another second, the arrows stopped.

After a few further tests with the guard‚Äôs various remains, Geela contented herself that any remaining traps were cleared, and she sauntered into the chambers without further ado. She almost looked regal, strolling in, as if she hadn‚Äôt just thrown an ear into the room before diving for cover behind a column. No one had seen that, so it hadn‚Äôt happened.

Terha‚Äôs rooms were, as she‚Äôd expected, empty. Not even really disappointing. The odds that Terha was in this castle had been so low that she‚Äôd have honestly been *more* disappointed if the Pirate Queen *had* been here. About seven minutes had passed since the first guard had vanished off to report the potential breakin, so she had another eight minutes til the guard reached her destination and another fifteen before she got back to the rooms. Geela had twenty-three minutes to get what she came for, rig the place to blow, and clear house.

Easy.

Geela first went off to the side room, Terha‚Äôs built-in study, and began throwing anything and everything in her bag. Darkos could sort it later; she had to move. The study wasn‚Äôt terribly packed with letters but it was somehow better sorted than Nefaria‚Äôs. For all the woman‚Äôs bragging about being a good clerk, she really hadn‚Äôt been all that well organized.

Once she finished with the study, Geela did a round of the woman‚Äôs bedroom, throwing anything interesting into her bag. There were some enchanted pieces of jewelry in an ebony box that hummed with potential, and there was a *darling* tiara that Geela just needed to have. After finishing her raid of Terha‚Äôs closet, Geela flung on one of the woman‚Äôs peacock feather robes and grabbed a purely ornamental sword, to complete her look. As she strode to the window, her watch let out a ping, reminding her to send Morris his signal to get into position. Dammit. Darkos had insisted she set her watch to give her a reminder. Geela had insisted she didn‚Äôt need it, but Darkos gave her this whole dramatic bit about how she was bad at remembering to give signals. To placate him, she‚Äôd agreed to set her watch.

Damn boy had been right. He could never know.

She tapped the side of her watch, sending a little jolt to her assistant. He should be in place, given his next target hadn‚Äôt been terribly far from where he‚Äôd been on lookout. After about three minutes, she got a little zap back. Good. Morris was in position with two minutes to go.

Geela threw open the heavy curtains that hung across the large window, letting the warm jungle sun pour into the bedroom. The window opened with ease and she looked out over an immaculately landscaped courtyard, decked out with some palm trees. On the other end of the courtyard, Geela could see the wall leading to the outside world, which Morris had rigged, ready to blow with a string of explosions separate from her own.

She bobbed on her feet, feeling her springy shoes respond impatiently to the movement. It was almost time‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOh my god! Brad!‚Äù

Just on schedule.

‚ÄúGet a doctor!‚Äù

‚ÄúJanet, he‚Äôs super dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat blackbird, the door‚Äôs open!‚Äù

‚ÄúIs someone inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that Terha? By the window?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be. She‚Äôs too short.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be! There was no report of a boat leaving their ship.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how!‚Äù

Geela kept her back to the small squad as they murmured among themselves, trying to understand how Geela could possibly be here.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to tell you how.‚Äù She tossed them a sly look over her shoulder and they all gasped at her glowing green eyes. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm running late and I have a boat to catch.‚Äù

At this, just on schedule, the wall below leading from the courtyard to the exterior of the property exploded in a remarkably small puff of smoke. She couldn‚Äôt have her great exit obscured.

‚ÄúTa ta for now,‚Äù she called, leaping to the windowsill, cape blowing dramatically around her in the wind. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say I‚Äôll see you later, but I highly doubt it.‚Äù

With this, she leaped from the window, sailing through the air down into the courtyard below, where she landed with uncharacteristic grace, all shock absorbed into her boot‚Äôs enchantments.

Back above, she heard shouting.

‚ÄúSomeone get her!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet someone to the courtyard.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs getting away!‚Äù

Geela paid them no mind as she crossed over the rubble of the wall, cloak trailing in the leaf mold beneath her feet. She‚Äôd just heard the opening of doors, the guards flowing into the courtyard, when she raised a hand and pressed down a diamond ring.

The plasma blast charges erupted. The entire property, following the strict ring of the walls, flooded high with pink and purple smoke, screams from the guards behind her silencing in an instant.

Naturally, Geela didn‚Äôt turn back, even if Morris did. It was good, having a minion who still looked back at the explosions. Darkos had learned by now never to, and Jane would probably be too scared, but it was always a good look, purposefully walking away from an explosion, minion gawking in fear at the carnage she‚Äôd just caused.

‚ÄúC‚ÄîCaptain.‚Äù Morris‚Äôs voice was hushed with terror, but Geela still didn‚Äôt turn.

‚ÄúCome along, minion,‚Äù she said, shoulders still held high. ‚ÄúWe must return to the shore. Our crew is waiting for us.‚Äù

Coronation of Hermann I!,lgo491,Stahlvorhang,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stahlvorhang/comments/lgo491/coronation_of_hermann_i/,"""Possibly chagrined by the fact that he had no ‚Äúhead of state,‚Äù with his unfailing talent for choosing the contemptible he now offered the Holy Crown of St. Stephen to Goring! The Reichsmarshal, although greatly flattered by the offer, explained that he had to have the Fuhrer‚Äôs approval before he could give a definite answer, and that the ‚Äúmilitary situation has to change in the favor of the Axis‚Äù before the coronation could take place. Nevertheless, Arrow Cross experts went to work to establish kinship between the Goring family and the House of Arpad, and to forge a coat of arms and other appropriate credentials to endow the newest Apostolic King of Hungary with the proper noble aura.""

Symbolism of Magia Record: Connecting with Mito,i3jbxv,magiarecord,https://www.reddit.com/r/magiarecord/comments/i3jbxv/symbolism_of_magia_record_connecting_with_mito/,"Previous: [The Science of Hinano](https://www.reddit.com/r/magiarecord/comments/i228gj/symbolism_if_magia_record_the_science_of_hinano/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

[Have you ever seen something so cute that you felt your heart pressure spike?](https://images.puella-magi.net/5/52/Mito_Papa_Seal_2019.jpg?20190420193536) There are a lot of adorable girls in Magia Record, but Mito really warrants a few insulin shots. What I think makes Mito, in particular, stand out is the fact that she's always being herself--everything she says/do is from her raw thoughts, which makes this cinnamon roll a pure-hearted bundle of joy.

\*Phew\*

As crazy as it may sound, there is a purpose to my doting on Mito, in that being so honest/innocent is a major part of her background. Mito is, put simply, what some would consider to be an eccentric, but also a girl who, for how merry she actually is, is also pretty deep at times. Mito treasures her friends, Leila and Seika, as they do her, and while there bond is mostly a positive one, as we will see in this analysis, it also is rather restrictive to Mito.

# A Bundle of Joy

Mito's appearance is one with some cleverly placed accessories, and at first glance, there really isn't anything that sticks out about it. Wielding a similar weapon type as Iroha, it's not very surprising that the two would both sport a hooded cloak and light clothing, but Mito has some rather small details that give us a little insight to her character.

Starting at Mito's hair, or to be specific, her twin buns, we see that they are bound by series of clovers. As we look down toward her Soulgem, we can also see that it is the fastener to her coat that also takes the form of a clover. To be specific, they are four-leaf clovers, which we all probably known as symbols of good luck and fortune, if not from being exposed to Lucky Charms cereal. This is good and all, but how is that significant to Mito's character?

The purpose of hairbands is to tie/bind hair together, while a fastener and zipper are what we use to hold our jackets/coats closed together. Given this and the symbolism behind 4 leaf clovers, we can interpret Mito's attire as being bounded together by virtue and positive feelings.

Mito shares a close bond with her 2 friends, whom she lives in the same apartment as, so it's pretty safe to say that her relationship with Leila and Seika are things she holds closest. Afterall, clovers  grow in large patches, but 4 leaf variants are far more uncommon than the traditional 3 leaf clovers. As such, Mito's friendship is something she personally perceives as a huge rarity/fortune.

Aside from that, Mito vaguely resembles that of a squirrel, with her mouth in her neutral expression being drawn in a similar fashion as anime characters with animal-like features and associations. This isn't necessary limited to squirrel-like characters, which are rare to begin with (only one that comes to mind is Makoto Nanaya from the Blazblue series), but to support this a bit, Mito's hood, when put up, looks like the form of a mammal (with the buttons being the ""eyes"" and two raised parts on either side of her head being ""ears""), while her coat, armbands, and footwear have tufts of white fur. All this, alone, only vaguely resembles a squirrel, but we then learn of Mito's love for acorns, which include her talent for ""hearing"" them, and an absolutely adorable tendency that she shares in one of her tap quotes:

>*I used to be obsessed with collecting acorns. I made secret hidin' spots for'em all across the complex! And actually... they're still hidden to this day!*

In addition to this, she also offers one for you to eat, which, because acorns aren't naturally suited for humans to eat, then tests your willpower: would you eat it to see Mito smile at the cost of potentially getting sick? If you read my previous analysis on Felicia, you may know that this is leading right up to another list of animal facts, this time being for squirrels.

Much like Mito here, squirrels are known for collecting and burying acorns so that they may prepare for the winter season, making them excellent for the growth of certain trees. While they fully intend to eat the seeds from trees, you might have noticed that they tend to drop them all over the place while traveling around. If you were to stand outside during Fall, you may see what appears to be 2 squirrels chasing and fighting each other, and this is either based on a territorial dispute or one squirrel being pursued after having stolen an acorn the other squirrel had stored. Between this and birds also wanting in on the action, it's understandable how effective these animals can be with spreading tree seeds. 

Given the fact that squirrels nest inside of trees, this brings us to an interesting reference based on the fact that trees are best spawned when they a separated from each other. The reason for this, of course, is that *they need plenty of room to grow,* and I stress this as something to keep in mind as you read this analysis.

Squirrels are also known to be hyperactive, usually as a means to escape and throw off threats which...sadly isn't so effective on cars, but let's not think about that as we describe Mito. Above, I mentioned that chasing each other around trees might indicate a rivalry, but it's also how they play with each other, difference being that they aren't intentionally trying to knock each other off of tree branches.

With that being said, squirrels are really friendly creatures, to the point where you could work to build one's trust through the power of food and by approaching them steadily. Once this bond is created, a squirrel will likely hang around your home, perhaps even letting you pet them, and there are actually parks out there that are designed with this in mind. All this is familiar to Mito, a girl who is energetic and absolutely lovely to be around. 

# Mito: A Girl Pure, Imaginative, and Confined

[Before moving on, I'd suggest watching/listening to Mito's lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kjIPpft1Fs).

I mentioned thise earlier, but Mito is *really* eccentric, and this is especially remarkable in a game where we have characters like Alina (although Mito is, fortunately, far less extreme). From the way she introduces herself, to her creative ways to play using common materials, to literally all of her quotes, Mito is a girl who avoids normalcy in favor of paths and approaches less ventured.

This is actually a very realistic personality trait seen among youth that indicates very high levels of creativity and a keen understanding of others, even if an individual chooses to socialize with a small group of friends. Of course, this is something that is very positive down the road, but, unfortunately, kids can be cruel and use that to isolate and deride a child. This is exactly the case with Mito in her event and one of the reasons her parents have decided to move out of their apartment and into a different area.

This is, of course, not taken well by Mito and her best friends, and even the writers, at first, push this as a negative time in Mito's life. However, there are also key references around that justify this change in environment as being *positive* for Mito. Starting with the Memoria, *Hello From the Stairwell:*

>*Leila, Seika, and Mito have lived together in this apartment complex since they were little and always loved racing up and down the stairs! Those steps felt so huge before, and now they walk them so easily. The world may get smaller, but their friendship keeps growing!*

The stairs, or, more specifically, the girls running up/down the stairs, in this Memoria describes the passage of time as the girls grew up together. What's most peculiar is the last line, which states that Mito's world is growing smaller. This can literally be taken as the girls growing up in an environment that remains the same size as when they were children, but also as a reference to the effects of Mito being confined to a single apartment and with the same group of friends.

While we can also apply this to Leila and Seika, this rings especially true for Mito, in that she *really* needs a larger space/opportunity to grow. Mito's imagination is extremely large, and given from what we hear of her tendency to travel around the outside parts of her home, being kept in that apartment with the same 2 friends is akin to having a shark be raised in a fish-tank. This rings especially true in an environment when most her peers don't accept and actively go against the very things that makes Mito special.

One common piece of imagery in Mito's animations (particularly her Magia and Doppel) are vine-like growth covered with thorns. We can actually understand the relation to Mito by interpreting these things literally, where an area covered in wild plant growth is harder to traverse through, given how likely it is to be ""snagged"" while moving, while thorns act as a deterrent for mobility. Likewise, there's the phrase ""every rose has its thorns"" which means that even something beautiful also has an ""ugly"" or dangerous side to it.

All things considered, Leila and Seika are *very* good for Mito, and growing up with them has brought few things that aren't positive. The issue here is simply the fact that Mito really deserves the opportunity to spread her wings further and put her imagination to full use in an environment that supports such a thing. Much like traversing through a wild field full of overgrowth and thorns, though, it is, understandably, hard for Mito to leave the apartment she was raised in/friends she grew up with.

# Akakiy, the Doppel of Unity

This finally brings us to Mito's Doppel, Akakiy, which is described as such:

>*The Doppel of unity. Its form is a coat. The master of this Doppel wishes for beautiful friendships to last for eternity. This Doppel answers that desire by compressing everything it captures into a single concentrated lump, which turns into an unbreakable crystal that will shine for thousands of years. Attacks by the Doppel are made by crystallizing its master's emotions, but continued use of this power causes even the master's memories to harden, making it impossible to create new ones.*

Akakiy refers to Akakiy Akakievich Bashmachkin from *The Overcoat*, a story written by Russian author, Nikolai Gogol. The main character's name is comically strange by design, roughly translating to ""unsightly"" and ""useless"", but also ""innocent"". The story focuses on the life of Akakiy, a poor transcriber without any outward remarkable qualities. Despite this, Akakiy is a very hardworker, something that is even recognized by his peers, but because of his poor and weak appearance, is often teased by fellow co-workers, who mostly target Akakiy's ragged overcoat.

This bullying gets to Akakiy, who seeks to have it refurbished, only to be turned down by the tailor, Petrovich, stating that the coat was beyond repair and that Akakiy needed to buy a new one. Given his small salary, it was necessary for Akakiy to save money. After having done so, Akakiy and Petrovich go off to collect materials to craft a new coat, and with dedication and hard-work, Petrovich tailors a coat so well-made that Akakiy becomes the talk of his workplace.

Akakiy would enjoy the positive attention from his peers, leading to his boss holding a party to celebrate his new coat. At first being excited, Akakiy, while attending the party, discovers that he does not truly mesh with others there, instead preferring his mundane life and the time he shared with Petrovich as they were crafting his overcoat. Eventually, Akakiy would leave the party, but as he entered a rough part of his city, he would then be mugged by 3 ruffians who stole his coat at knifepoint.

Akakiy would then attempt to get help from police in a nearby police station but, being repulsed by his unkempt appearance, only mocked and derided Akakiy. In the next day, Akakiy would then seek help from his superior at his workstation, who absolutely tore into Akakiy for burdening him with such a ""trivial"" issue. Being a man with low social adaptations, this encounter would scar Akakiy, who eventually loses his sanity and, in a fever dream, dies while imagining himself begging for forgiveness.  

Now a vengeful ghost, Akakiy haunts his city, stealing the overcoats of passersby and, after finding the superior who berated him, traumatized and filled him with guilt. Satisfied, Akakiy would finally move on to the afterlife.

The overcoat in this story represents status but also a concept of *value*. To Akakiy, it is what bonded him with his co-workers, although he would discover that such a bond was superficial and fragile, as, after having lost it, he would, in turn, lose that respect he had from others around him. 

In addition to its general appearance being an overcoat, Mito's doppel also sports what looks to be an arrow-cross symbol in the center flap (which might be its ""head""). This symbol is associated with ""the fisher of men"" as described in Christianity. The phrase refers to a moment where Jesus called for his 2 disciples to follow him to learn to better catch fish, but can also be interpreted as the ability/need to fully understand others in order to attract them to you. Taken more literally, a coat is an article of clothing, outerwear, that ""binds"" together the rest of your wardrobe. In that sense, it keeps your outfit together as one.

When attacking, Akakiy lets loose a field of crystalized overgrowth and thorns, which entrap targets into a sack, constricting and tightening its grip until it explodes. As mentioned earlier, thorns and certain plant growth deter one's mobility, keeping them in one place, and in this particular case, the crystals Akakiy produce are more beautiful, but also extra dangerous and restrictive as a result. Much like the contents of a bag, those who are trapped within it are stuck together, but are unable to experience the environment outside of it.

The bond between Mito and her friends is one that is beautiful and strong, but limiting herself to just them would come at the cost of losing the potential to learn the beauties outside their circle, or, more literally, their apartment. This is a similar concept to the Amane Twins, whose Doppels bring them together, but isolates them from the outside world.

Mito's story is, thus, a lesson to treasure those you hold dearly to you, but also understand the potential beauty outside of your own walls. While close friendships can very well last a lifetime, it is also important to explore more and discover new experiences that can help you grow.

How Involved Was the Catholic Church With Mass Murder Committed by Fascist Paramilitaries In Hungary and Yugoslavia in WW2?,l2xxyr,AskHistorians,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l2xxyr/how_involved_was_the_catholic_church_with_mass/,"In Richard J Evans's  *The Third Reich at War*, the complicity of some members of the Catholic Church in the murder of Jews and forced conversions of Orthodox believers in Yugoslavia in conjunction with the fascist Ustashe as well as in the mass murders of Jews committed by the Hungarian fascist group Arrow Cross is mentioned briefly but not expounded upon particularly significantly

Two paragraphs come to mind:

 ""The first concentration camp in Croatia opened at the end of April 1941, and on 26 June a law was enacted providing for a network of camps across the country. The purpose of the camps was.... to exterminate ethnic and religious minorities. In the Jasenovac camp system alone, more than 20,000 Jews are thought to have perished. Death was above all to disease and malnutrition, but Ustashe militia, egged on by some Franciscan friars, frequently beat inmates to death with hammers in night-long sessions of mass murder.... The head of the Catholic Church in Croatia, Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac... declared that the hand of God was at work in the removal of the Serbian Orthodox Yoke "" pg 159

And in Hungary -

""[Ferenc Sz√°lasi] began murdering surviving Jews across Budapest, assisted in some cases by Catholic priests, one of whom, Father Kun, got into the habit of shouting 'in the name of Christ, fire!' as the Arrow Cross paramilitaries levelled their guns at their Jewish victims"" pg 645

How aware was the Church Hierarchy that these events were taking place?  It seems difficult to believe that the Church would be totally unaware of its member's participation in activities of ultra-catholic fascist groups.

Historical Battles Involving Anarchists 1903 - 2015,jcildq,Anarchism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/jcildq/historical_battles_involving_anarchists_1903_2015/,"This is a list of anarchist battle honours, [compiled](https://drinkingwithghosts.blogspot.com/2016/12/anarchist-battle-honours-1903-2015.html) by South African historian Michael Schmidt. Despite his excellent work as a historian, it's important to note he was either exposed as or became a white supremacist (or at least, felt black people wouldn't be a part of an anarchist revolution, which is all kinds of fucked up). That doesn't invalidate anything on this list, but should be noted if you explore more of his work. I've included extra references whereever I can. I deleted all generic ""resistance"" and ""urban guerilla"" entries to keep this post under the word limit

* 1944: Liberation of Paris, France. The first Allied troops into Paris were the 114 anarchist CNT and FAI veterans of the old Durruti Column, organised as the 9th Armoured Company ‚Äì a division of  the Free French 2nd Armoured Division under General Leclerc ‚Äì and driving tanks and armoured half-tracks flying the Spanish Republican  flag and with names redolent of the Spanish Revolution painted on their  sides: ‚ÄúDurruti‚Äù, ‚ÄúAscaso‚Äù, ‚ÄúCasa Viejas‚Äù, ‚ÄúTeruel‚Äù, ‚ÄúMadrid‚Äù,  ‚ÄúBelchite‚Äù, ‚ÄúGuadalajara‚Äù and ‚ÄúGuernica‚Äù. The 9th took the honours  in Paris, accepting the surrender of General Dietrich von Choltitz and  his 17,000-strong Nazi garrison. The 9th then fought its way across  Europe, campaigning in Alsace-Lorraine, helping to liberate cities such as Strasbourg and numerous towns, fighting in Germany, passing through  the Dachau concentration camp just after it had been liberated by the Americans and concluding its campaign only when it seized Hitler's  ‚ÄúEagle‚Äôs Nest‚Äù mountain retreat at Berchtesgarten in Bavaria, being the first force to enter this innermost sanctuary of elitist Nazism.
* 1944: Battle of the Val d‚ÄôAr√°n, Catalonia, Spain. 7,000 Anarchist and Communists Anarchists, beliving Franco would be defeated by World War II, invaded Spain from France. They took several towns but faced over 40,000 enemy soldiers. Leading to their retreat and/or capture or executions.

* 2014: Defence of Koban√™, Rojava. Anarchists fight in the Rojava Revolution against the fascist Islamic State, lifting the siege of Koban√™.

**Statistics**

* Of the 36 battles listed here. 19 were led by anarchists and 17 saw anarchists fighting in coalitions.
* When anarchists lead battles, they achieve their goals 79% of the time.
* When anarchists participate in a coalition, the coalition achieves their goals 83% of the time.

**Conclusions**

We can overwhelmingly conclude that the notion that anarchists are bad at warfare is a myth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you like her,‚Äù Arrow, the shelter owner‚Äôs son, said. ‚ÄúI love cats and dogs, but honestly, um‚Ä¶ birds freak me out a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs this asking me if I drink?‚Äù I asked, sitting at the scratched-up desk with the adoption paperwork.

‚ÄúWe gotta make sure the animals are going to good home environments. Dad‚Äôs words, not mine.‚Äù

I took my ballpoint pen and checked the box next to *No*.

*Do you smoke at least one cigarette per day?*

I checked *Yes*.

*Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a felony?*

‚ÄúI got caught streaking in college once,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDoes that count?‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe question about felony.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Arrow said, creeping toward Martini‚Äôs cage while clutching a plastic puppy carrier like a weapon. ‚ÄúDamn, mister, were you a frat boy back in the day or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndecent exposure is usually a misdemeanor. We‚Äôre asking for murder, vehicular homicide, larceny, things like that.‚Äù

I wrinkled my nose. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, and animal cruelty. That‚Äôs a felony too.‚Äù

I checked *No*. The final line of the five-page form requested my signature and the date. I obliged.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Gimme a sec, mister. Let me just, um‚Ä¶‚Äù

I watched as Arrow pinched the door of the birdcage with his thumb and forefinger and gingerly pulled it open. Then he shoved the open mouth of the puppy carrier against it, making the entire cage rattle. Martini jumped and fluttered madly behind her wire bars. Arrow scrambled back, dropping his carrier to the newspaper-lined floor with a loud clatter.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your father, and why did he leave you in charge?‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Holman,‚Äù a new voice said.

Using her claws and beak, Martini climbed up to the open door of her cage and peered at the redheaded boy cowering behind me, then at the man who had entered through the back door.

‚ÄúApologies for my absence,‚Äù Phillip, the shelter manager, said. ‚ÄúI hope Arrow hasn‚Äôt been causing you too much trouble. He‚Äôs prone to making a mess of things.‚Äù

Arrow poked his head out from behind me and looked at the birdcage, where Martini had slowly pulled herself out of captivity. She turned her attention to me as I scooted back in my chair and got up. I walked up to her slowly, trying not to alarm her. Her eyes shone in the afternoon sunlight filtering through the skylight.

‚ÄúIs she clipped?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Phillip said. ‚ÄúShe can fly, but only just. She has been kept indoors her entire life.‚Äù

‚ÄúI knew that,‚Äù Arrow gasped. ‚ÄúPut her in the carrier, just in case, you know?‚Äù

I picked up the carrier he‚Äôd dropped. Martini craned her neck this way and that, showing the rows of unopened pin feathers running down her back. I held out my hand. Martini flinched.

‚ÄúGood bird,‚Äù I said gently. ‚ÄúHi, Martini. I‚Äôm here to take you home.‚Äù

Martini stared at my hand. I curled my fingers slightly.

‚ÄúStep up.‚Äù

Martini turned her head side to side, then hesitantly climbed onto my hand.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs trained,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHer old master had her for a while,‚Äù Phillip said. ‚ÄúThe sweet old lady passed away too early. That‚Äôs why shelters like ours have to exist.‚Äù

Martini let out a low chirp and ruffled her feathers. Arrow scrambled into the corner, shielding his face.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making her nervous,‚Äù I said, coaxing Martini into the carrier.

Phillip picked up my paperwork and looked it over.

‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt like birds,‚Äù Arrow whimpered. ‚ÄúI thought a parrot might be cool, ‚Äòcause they talk and stuff, but Martini doesn‚Äôt talk. She just‚Ä¶ just flaps.‚Äù

I closed the plastic door of the carrier and smiled.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because she‚Äôs nervous around you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAfrican Greys are some of the best talking parrots in the world. I‚Äôm sure Martini will get around to it under the care of someone‚Ä¶ more *experienced*.‚Äù

Arrow grumbled and rolled his eyes.

==========

Martini was shy and easily spooked, as many shelter birds tended to be. She was trained to step up to human hands and responded to her name, but like Arrow said, she didn‚Äôt seem keen to talk or mimic any sounds. In fact, she was exceptionally quiet, only making the occasional nervous chitter.

Every morning, I opened up her cage and offered her a greeting, in the hopes of getting her to grow used to my voice.

‚ÄúGood morning, Martini.‚Äù

She shied away from me and flapped her wings. For the first couple of days, the closest thing she did to flying was hopping from perch to perch when I wasn‚Äôt watching and making her nervous.

‚ÄúGood morning, Martini,‚Äù I said again. ‚ÄúWanna get out?‚Äù

Martini chittered quietly.

‚ÄúWanna get out?‚Äù

She reluctantly climbed up to her door. I held out my hand.

‚ÄúStep up.‚Äù

She carefully wrapped her claws around my fingers, one foot at a time.

‚ÄúGood bird,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGood bird, Martini.‚Äù

I kept her perched on my shoulder for most of the mornings while I cooked breakfast and made coffee. Every time, I fed her a piece of my toast, which she chewed slowly before swallowing. Then I put her back in her cage before going to work.

Martini was a smart bird, and soon enough, she figured out how to open the latch of her cage door from the inside while I was gone for work. I worried that she might hurt herself exploring the house while I wasn‚Äôt around, but she only climbed around the outside of her cage until I came home. Otherwise, she was well-behaved if a little cautious, and even her wariness began to fade as we spent more and more time together. Our greatest achievement was when she finally succeeded in recall training, where I called out ‚ÄúMartini, come find me,‚Äù and she flew clear across the room to my hand.

Three weeks into her new life with me, Martini finally relaxed enough to make sounds other than her nervous chitters. What came out first was a low murmur, an incomprehensible string of words that vaguely sounded like human speech. It was another week or so until she began saying things I could understand, and it wasn‚Äôt so much the things she said but the way she said them that began to bother me.

Most of a parrot‚Äôs speech consisted of things that she had heard before, down to the voice and inflection. When Martini spoke, though, the voice that she mimicked belonged neither to me nor to a ‚Äúsweet old lady‚Äù I‚Äôd been told was her former owner; it was the steady, low murmur of a man, tinged with an unfamiliar accent.

‚Äú*Martini,*‚Äù she said. ‚Äú*Good girl, Martini. Martini wanna peanut?*‚Äù

Throughout the evening, Martini grew talkative at an alarming rate. She talked more and more, and everything she said was in this stranger‚Äôs voice:

‚Äú*Pretty bird.*‚Äù

‚Äú*Good evening.*‚Äù

‚Äú*Wanna read the news together?*‚Äù

‚Äú*Say you‚Äôre sorry.*‚Äù

‚Äú*I‚Äôm sorry. Sorry.*‚Äù

By the time I had put her in her cage for the night, she had started laughing.

Then, as I climbed into bed, she began to scream.

I can‚Äôt transcribe the things she was screaming, because the words were once again garbled. Perhaps Martini‚Äôs slender tongue had trouble reproducing the guttural sounds, but it sounded more like the voice was muffled, fighting through layers of cloth.

I slowly pulled away my sheets and climbed out of bed. As I made my way to Martini‚Äôs room, she began to make choking sounds.

I ran and stumbled into her room. Martini fell silent. She peered at me from inside her cage, her eyes glistening in the orange light of the hallway.

‚ÄúMartini, are you okay?‚Äù

She cocked her head and turned around on her perch. Then she opened her beak and started screaming again.

They were human sounds. There was no doubt about it. Martini screamed like a man slowly getting strangled.

Then, in an instant, her voice changed. She was now a young woman, letting out a piercing cry as if she had been stabbed. The woman screamed out words until her voice too was quickly muffled.

‚Äú*What is this?*‚Äù Martini screamed. ‚Äú*Who are you? I‚Äôm going to call the police-*‚Äù

Martini bobbed her head and mimicked the sound of heavy footsteps over a hardwood floor. The *thump* of bodies.

‚Äú*Please,*‚Äù she murmured, this time another man, a different one. ‚Äú*Please, don‚Äôt do this.*‚Äù

She smacked her beak a couple of times, then fell silent.

I stared at her. My body felt stiff.

‚Äú*Martini. Good bird, Martini. Wanna peanut?*‚Äù

‚ÄúMartini,‚Äù I whispered absently. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

She cocked her head, then hopped to the bottom of her cage and began picking at her toys.

‚Äú*Good bird,*‚Äù she murmured, in the accented man‚Äôs voice. ‚Äú*Good bird. Step up.*‚Äù

==========

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been *screaming*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I breathed. ‚ÄúIn‚Ä¶ in so many different voices. Where‚Äôs your dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs on a business trip,‚Äù Arrow said. ‚ÄúNot the shelter. His other business.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen does he come back?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno. On Saturday, I think.‚Äù

I let out an exasperated sigh. I was pacing up and down the newspaper-covered aisles of the shelter. A tiny dog began to bark as I walked past its enclosure.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs she scream?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSome weird things.‚Äù

Arrow‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúSo she really talks?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the problem here,‚Äù I snapped.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome. You‚Äôre a miracle-worker, mister.‚Äù

I rubbed my fingers on my temple.

‚ÄúWho was Martini‚Äôs last owner?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWas it actually an old lady?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what my dad told me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why does she talk in a man‚Äôs voice? And all those other voices‚Ä¶‚Äù

Arrow crossed his arms. ‚ÄúMaybe the lady had a lot of visitors?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what about the screaming?‚Äù

Arrow shrugged.

‚ÄúDid Martini have any owners before this *old lady*?‚Äù

‚ÄúDunno.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is serious,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call the police.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you gonna tell them? That your bird is screaming at you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis could be anything. Those voices, they‚Äôve got to be real people. Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe what?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNever mind. You‚Äôre too young for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think Martini had a serial killer for an owner or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of movies have you been watching?‚Äù I grumbled, although he had taken the words out of my mouth.

‚ÄúThen what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was the name of Martini‚Äôs last owner?‚Äù

‚ÄúSheesh, mister. All that information‚Äôs classified. Privacy concerns and stuff. Maybe it‚Äôs written in Martini‚Äôs papers, but my dad has the key to that filing cabinet.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet me know when your dad‚Äôs back.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

==========

When I came home, Martini was climbing around the outside of her cage, muttering to herself in the accented man‚Äôs voice.

‚Äú*Say you‚Äôre sorry. Good girl, Martini. Wanna peanut? Good evening.*‚Äù

She let out a soft chuckling noise.

‚Äú*I‚Äôm sorry.*‚Äù

I kept her on my shoulder for most of the evening, hoping she would say things that could serve as clues. After dinner, Martini began to sob in a little boy‚Äôs voice. I dug my old audio recorder out of my drawer and recorded her.

The recorder could hold three hours‚Äô worth of audio. When I put Martini back in her cage for the night, I pressed the *record* button and laid the device next to it. It wouldn‚Äôt capture the whole night, but it surely would record until Martini fell asleep.

Martini muttered from her room as I climbed into bed, shut off the lights, and drifted off to sleep.

I woke to cold metal prodding at my forehead.

‚ÄúHey, mister,‚Äù a voice said. ‚ÄúGet up.‚Äù

I opened my eyes in slits. Something was hovering out-of-focus in front of my face, and beyond it, the face of a redheaded boy stared down at me in the dim streetlights coming through my window.

My eyes grew wide.

‚ÄúArrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúSheesh, you‚Äôre loud,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing personal, okay, mister?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúI called Dad,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe told me to go and silence you.‚Äù

‚Äú*What?*‚Äù

Arrow shoved the muzzle of his double-barreled shotgun into my cheek.

‚ÄúI told you, it‚Äôs nothing personal. You‚Äôre actually a miracle-worker, you know that? Martini‚Äôs never been a snitch like that before. She was quiet. That‚Äôs why Dad kept giving her out.‚Äù

‚ÄúGiving her‚Ä¶ out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a mouthful of questions, aren‚Äôt ya,‚Äù Arrow said. He waved the barrel of his shotgun over my eyes, and I yelped.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the family business,‚Äù he said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúThe one that actually makes money. It‚Äôs a shame Dad took the doctors with him, else we could‚Äôve used you, too. Hold on.‚Äù

Arrow hoisted his leg up onto my bed and propped his shotgun on his knee. Then he rummaged in his pocket with one hand, pulled out a folded-up bundle of paper, and shook it until it unfurled. In the dim light of the room, I could see the words *shelter* and *adoption* flash by, along with bits of my handwriting. A signature here and there.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre a smoker, huh?‚Äù Arrow said, glancing over my adoption paperwork for Martini. ‚ÄúAt least we know we‚Äôre not wasting a good pair of lungs. Liver would‚Äôve been nice, though, ‚Äòcause they usually bring in a pretty penny if the doctors manage to take it out alive. And the kidneys, of course‚Ä¶‚Äù

At that moment, the gravity of the situation hit me full-force.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to *kill* me?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me, mister, I‚Äôd love not to. But jeez, your house was pretty hard to get into, and I‚Äôd hate for the work to go to waste, and we‚Äôve got to get rid of you pretty quick, so-‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you. You worked some magic and Martini snitched on us. You were gonna call the police. I‚Äôm here to shut you up.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lady,‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúMartini was never owned by an old lady, was she?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah,‚Äù Arrow said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all made up. We give out pets so we can get loners‚Äô addresses in the paperwork.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Ä¶ you-‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, we don‚Äôt do much. It‚Äôs the doctors who take people away. Open ‚Äòem up while they‚Äôre fresh. You know, the waiting list for organ transplants is years long. No one‚Äôs got years to live when their body‚Äôs failing.‚Äù

Arrow let out an indignant huff.

‚ÄúPity we won‚Äôt get some social service out of you, huh? What a waste. But Dad says you‚Äôve got to go *now*.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to find out. You know that, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt,‚Äù Arrow laughed. ‚ÄúThough in your case, the cover-up might be a bit messy. Like I said, we usually go after loners. People without a whole lotta social connections.‚Äù

Small scrabbling noises came from Martini‚Äôs room. She had woken up to the sound of voices.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the snitch,‚Äù Arrow muttered, grinning. ‚ÄúAfter you‚Äôre dead, I‚Äôm gonna shoot her too. Just to make sure another parrot wizard doesn‚Äôt pick her up and get her talking again.‚Äù

Arrow shoved my paperwork back into his pocket and raised the barrels of his shotgun up to my forehead.

‚ÄúBye-bye, mister. I‚Äôd say it was nice doing business with you, but you‚Äôre a victim of your own curiosity, not me.‚Äù

I swallowed the lump in my throat, and in a last-ditch effort, screamed the only thing I could think of.

‚ÄúMartini, come find me!‚Äù

From the other room came the scratching of claws on the sides of the cage, and then the flutter of wings.

A split second later, Martini flew into the room, her wingbeats blowing tiny down feathers onto my bed. Arrow let out an alarmed yelp, ducking for cover as he swung the twin barrels of his gun up to the ceiling.

Two deafening shots went off. Their flashes were blinding. Chalky debris rained down from the popcorn ceiling. Martini squawked.

Arrow dove into the corner of my bedroom, sending his gun clattering onto the floor. I scrambled out of my bed, scooped it up, and pointed it at him.

I glanced back at my bed, where Martini had landed. A portion of the feathers at the tip of her left wing were missing, but the massive bulk of the shots had missed her.

I turned back to Arrow.

‚ÄúT-that thing‚Äôs empty,‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got nothing on me. You don‚Äôt even know how to hold a gun. You‚Ä¶ you think I‚Äôm scared?‚Äù

I took a shaky breath, trying to calm my pounding heartbeats.

‚ÄúYour father was right about one thing,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou have a way of making a mess of things.‚Äù

I spun the shotgun one-eighty and held the barrels in my hand.

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre scared of a big man with a bat. And even more than that, I think you‚Äôre scared of Martini. So just try to run, kid.‚Äù

Arrow whimpered.

‚Äú*Good bird,*‚Äù Martini chirped in the young woman‚Äôs voice. ‚Äú*Good bird.*‚Äù

==========

Arrow was jailed. If the shotgun and the holes in my ceiling weren‚Äôt enough evidence, the last ten minutes of the audio recording from Martini‚Äôs room certainly were.

Phillip and his crew of doctors were arrested in their business hotel and flown home immediately for detainment with Arrow. Police found evidence of fifteen victims of organ theft, and they‚Äôre looking for more.

Martini has begun molting. I‚Äôm hoping she can fly again when her flight feathers grow back in. She still sends chills down my back with the odd giggle or scream, and I try not to think about how the originators of the voices are all dead now.

On a brighter note, recently she has started mimicking my voice.

third Aryan brotherhood leader?,pf6oaf,TNOmod,https://www.reddit.com/r/TNOmod/comments/pf6oaf/third_aryan_brotherhood_leader/,"we have two leaders for the same Russia unifier both with different ideologies views and goals it would be hard to believe their different leaders for the same faction with how different they are.

examples 

vagner  believes aryanism is not biological but psychological accentual social Darwinism  the weak must fear the strong and they must join the Reich 

valamir thinks that not only are Slavs Aryans but in fact the true Aryans and the Germans are pretenders and Palestine is the Aryan homeland 

both hate Jews and other minorities  (vagners psychology theory could contradict this and create an interesting dynamic ironically in practice he might be less racist then valamir)

both hate Russian culture and people to some extent but again for very different reasons and want to both copy and correct the Germans in some way in their definition of Aryan.

religion for example 

vagner enforces state atheism 

valamir enforces a Neo-pagan theocracy 

both hate the Abraham  faiths in all forms but for different reasons 

ideology 

vagner is national socialist 

valamir is ultra nationalist 

international relations

vagner wants to join the German faction and prove he and his organization are Aryans

valimir is hostile to Germany as  basically wants to pull an uno reverse card on them.

what i am trying to say is these two have very little in common and disagree more then agree the only thing that ties them together is their belief in aryanizing Russia and having to be apart of the same faction but what if their was a third a middle ground compromise between the two.

their are two focus tree paths the perfect few and the issue of slavery both split into separate branched that result in a different leader but what you go down one path for say valamir but another for vagner then what happens?.

a potential third leader would be some kind of hybrid bridge between the two a missing link that ties their ideas together this present all kinds of opportunities for example how would this brotherhood treat Slavs and Eurasian minorities  as apposed to vagners Nazi social Darwinism and valimirs mystic pan Slavic ultra nationalism.

how would he handle the issues above as opposed to his counterparts. 

i would love to get feedback so please comment.",8/31/2021 17:13,,,,,,

For being someone who is supposed to be a first rate German simp, I feel that he doesn't quite do enough to truly take after Germany. 

I hereby recommend that Vagner receive additional paths for each potential German leader. What do I mean by this? Well, it is simple.

Every time somebody wins the GCW or coups the leader of Germany, I want Vagner's ideology to change accordingly. If Bormann wins, all is well and the current AB path continues. But if Speer wins? Vagner picks up a German newspaper obtained by one of his guys in Moscowien and finds out that the Reich went reform Fash three years ago. This is different from what he's been doing so far, but the Germans know better than him, do he begins to gather a group of reform-minded individuals and alter his state accordingly. Speer remains supreme? Vagner remains Fash. Go4 victory? Suddenly democracy is what true Aryans do. DSR victory? Now Vagner is a communist running the Russkiy Volksreykh. Militarist and SS paths will exist too, of course. I want to see Vagner commit to the bit and jump through every hoop necessary to ape the condition of Germany. If Aryan is a state of mind, then Gutrum Vagner, loyal foster son of Germania, will do the mental gymnastics necessary to be Aryan. Thank you for coming to my talk.",7/22/2021 14:37,,,,,,

**The Ultravisionary Aryans**

‚Äã‚Äã*An Aryan Brotherhood Short Story*

""Hi. I'm Rita Kashirina. How's your day been?"" the svelte redhead in the long brown coat asked him as she sat down at the coffeeshop table with her morning coffee. Time to see how this date'd go.

""Guten tag. Avgustin Kryuger."" He smiled a little at that, sinking into an easy manner. He wore a collared shirt, a loose red tie, and trousers. It was all neatly pressed.

""That's an unusual name. Are you a German?""

""I'm Deytsch.""

""I'm sorry, what's a Deytsch?"" she asked. He in turn noted her fox fur shawl and heels that almost certainly were purchased on the black market.

""A Deytsch is a culture. From Perm. There aren't many of us left. Most found our conduct to be...untoward.""

""...Then you are a fascist?""

""Oh, no, of course not, I'm a devout Ultravisionary, as I'm guessing you are. I'm an Aryan, but I figure that if the Ultravisionaries beat us they must be strong enough to be Aryans in turn. It's clear that this country's best have an Aryan conquerer's state of mind.""

""...The Brotherhood enslaved people,"" she said.

""Yes. We did, but so do you. You just call it work camps, community service, or re-education. The Federation has a lot in common with Permhaym, I found it easy to adapt. Still, I am a true believer, don't you worry. Science for the benefit of all is a lovely dream.""

""You are a social fascist,"" she hissed.

""Rita, what do you do for a living?"" he asked, gently.

""...Why're you asking me that?""

""I just want to know. We may as well have this conversation so you can report the harmless Ultravisionary who chooses to use a Deytsch name and believe in silly things like Aryan Ultravisionaries. The one who was always known to be striving to be a Hero of Ultravisionary Labor and who hasn't done a single thing wrong, who has always followed the party line despite a few quirks.""

""...Fine. I work at the People's Commissariat of Science. Is that what you wanted to hear?""

""Sure. What do you do in the Commissariat?"" he asked.

""...We're working on this socialist productivity drug.""

""I assume you test it on rats?""

""No, rats wouldn't give an accurate assessment. We do it on people.""

""Whether they want to or not? I really don't mind, why don't you answer truthfully?""

""...Yes, we don't take their wishes into consideration. You are...transparently a heartless bastard,"" she said.

""And you are more subtly heartless. I'd be willing to bet that neither of us actually care about proletarians or Russians or the like. In fact, I don't think I have the brain chemistry for it. As far as I can tell I was born without empathy and without a conscience, and I've been a law-abiding citizen despite that.""

""...Fine."" She looked around, noting that the coffee shop was mostly empty. She took a sip of her coffee. ""You're right. I...I don't know what that feels like either, and I'm doing just fine. I'm not a sadist, I want to make that clear. I just...don't feel some emotions, I never have.""

""Then you are an Aryan woman."" he smiled, raising his coffee. ""Cheers!"" She followed suit and they clinked paper cups, even as her face scrunched up.¬†

""I guess we're together in being savages,"" she said, though she didn't seem to bothered by that. She was more obviously annoyed that she'd been called out, frankly.

""No, we're Aryans and New Soviet People. Maybe I'm a savage, in the USF, someone who can't get over a little religious movement he was a part of, but you? You're the kind of person who gets things done. You're the kind of person who this country was made for. You're the kind of woman who's going to win us this war against the Hitlerites. Vagner had a lot of good ideas, and I liked being part of the Deytsch culture, but the Germans stopped being divine once Hitler died, and by now the United Soviet Federation is far more Aryan than the decadent Germans ever were.""

""Vagner was a moron, a cult leader, a slaver, and a mass murderer.""

""Do you actually care, or are you just saying that?""

""Well, I don't, except for the moron part. I don't think you should give respect to fools,"" she noted.

""He was less dumb than he looked, even if he lost. He kept the movement together. He was a visionary, like Hitler, like Bukharin, like Zhdanov.""

""You're a strange man, Mr. Kryuger,"" she noted, though something in her seemed to be coming to life.¬†

""I am. That's your advantage. You're a normal woman. I'm bound by my fondness for my traditions, but you? They'll never see you coming.""

""I don't want to have some kind of grand plan, though. I just want to do my work in the Commissariat and then go back to being a surgeon,"" she noted.

""Surgery. That requires cutting into people, right? I bet you'd find that easy. We aren't saddled by the issues that the sheep who the state watches over are. I like you, Rita, as much as people like us can. I just wish you wouldn't default to pretending to care about things like slavery.""

""It's a habit. I dislike slavery on ideological grounds, in that it prevents class consciousness, but yes, on moral grounds I'm not qualified to judge. Honestly, it's quite rare that I talk so openly about this kind of thing."" She sighed and rubbed her temples.

""...You know, you would have made a great Aryan Sister, if Vagner hadn't been emulating the worst parts of the Nazi government like their hatred for women. We could have doubled our armies with Aryans like you, but Vagner was too focused on being a man than being an Aryan. Again, I don't like all of what Vagner preached, but he got a lot more right than wrong.""

""That's about how I feel about Zhdanov, comrade.""

""I like Zhdanov better. I just wish he was less of a hypocrite. I think he genuinely believes this country is for the downtrodden proletariat. If he really wants his far-future galactic empire, he should stop pretending he's Suslov."" He laughed a little hollowly at that.

Rita nodded at Avgustin. ""What about Serov? I was always fond of Serov when I lived in Komi back in my twenties.""

Its legit one of the easiest Scouters for power-level In either bringing it up(only people who know about it are white ethnos and people who argue against them and miyo is not the latter), and its moral is ""a future where nuclear war happens because BROWN PEOPLE, STOP THEM BEFORE WE EXPLODE"" which feels a lot like, ""Little Timmy will be bullied, we must stop it before it's too late!.""

>The Turner Diaries is a 1978 novel by William Luther Pierce, published under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald.[1] It depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the federal government, a nuclear war, and, ultimately, a race war which leads to the systematic extermination of non-whites.[2][3] All groups opposed by the novel's protagonist, Earl Turner‚Äîincluding Jews, non-whites, ""liberal actors"", and politicians‚Äîare exterminated.[4]

>The Turner Diaries was described as ""explicitly racist and anti-Semitic"" by The New York Times and has been labeled the ""bible of the racist right"" by the FBI.[5][6] The book was greatly influential in shaping white nationalism and the later development of the white genocide theory. It has also inspired numerous hate crimes and acts of terrorism, including the 1984 assassination of Alan Berg, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and the 1999 London nail bombings.[7][8][9]

**Destiny should reference the similarities between the 14 words->then the Turner Diaries-> Little Timmy to highlight how this is the same racist garbage that's been around since the 70's at the very least.

Little Timmy might be a dog whistle for Timothy Mcveigh, or Timmy **Turner** from fairly oddparents. Just conjecture of course, but both are cringe enough to make sense for the followers of Booger Nick.",8/8/2021 22:41,,,,,,

According to them the greatest danger the country now face is the presence of too many black children in its schools: https://www.reddit.com/r/tucker_carlson/comments/maozul/no_doubt/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

One comment directly blame the situation on the fact Irish women have been given basic rights :

[The thing with Ireland is that the decline began in the 2000‚Äôs when most countries can trace their decline to the 1960‚Äôs, The county used to be extremely conservative. Women couldnt get abortions until 2018, women had to retire high level jobs when they married and contraceptives Were highly regulated til the 70‚Äôs, then they joined to eu in the 90‚Äôs and the decline began slowly, slowly began but has accelerated now.With the case of Sinn Fein, it was like Europe‚Äôs gaddafi, technically ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù but conservative in many aspects and wanted Ireland to not join the eu.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tucker_carlson/comments/maozul/comment/grv18p5)
 
At least two of the commenters are openly calling for a race war:

[Ten years ago this could have been fixed through peaceful means. When Ireland wakes up it is going to make the partition of India look like a stroll in the park. Never forget: Enoch was right.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tucker_carlson/comments/maozul/comment/grw71ne?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

[For it to be within a decade, every Irish person would have to die of strange causes. I imagine she meant more on the lines of a generation, not a decade, but even then she's likely to be wrong.I don't know the specifics of Ireland, but I know a bit about France and Sweden and you can find a similar situation in specific areas of those countries, while others are entirely native. That'd mean that within a generation the Gaelic language and culture wouldn't cease to exist but rather it is likely they found themselves heading towards civil war between the regions or facing a slow genocide. Even considering their situation in South Africa the Boers haven't disappeared, it is not that easy to wipe out a population and it is not sudden.Things will not just end, things will slowly deteriorathe and conflict will progressively escalate, it will not be an explosive painless death but strenuous years of squalor and agony. It's not unlike what Americans have been able to experience in California and other places these past few decades.You also would have to account for geographical positions, for instance in Sweden they could just cut part of the south of the country and be completely fine, just like Brazil could get rid of everything north of Rio de Janeiro and you could have in your hands a pretty good country. France on the other hand... maybe regions on either of its coasts could manage, but most of the central space is kinda doomed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tucker_carlson/comments/maozul/no_doubt/gruxxen?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

And obviously it is all the jews' fault somehow:

[Reminder this is happening because a certain group want it to, I fear the people are going to wake up too late, if at all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tucker_carlson/comments/maozul/no_doubt/grurtmq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

CMV: White Genocide is not complete nonsense and it's the fault of White Supremacists,mpmnjv,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mpmnjv/cmv_white_genocide_is_not_complete_nonsense_and/,"This isn't exactly high effort so let's use Wikipedia for references: 
>The¬†white genocide,¬†white extinction,[1]¬†or¬†white replacement conspiracy theory[2][3][4]¬†is a¬†white supremacist[5][6][7][8]¬†belief that there is a deliberate plot, often¬†blamed on Jews,[5][8]¬†to promote¬†miscegenation,[9]¬†interracial marriage, mass non-white¬†immigration,¬†racial integration,¬†low fertility rates,¬†abortion, governmental land-confiscation¬†from whites, organised¬†violence,[10]¬†and¬†eliminationism¬†in¬†white-founded countries[5]¬†in order to cause the¬†extinction¬†of¬†whites¬†through¬†forced assimilation[10]¬†and violent¬†genocide.[11][12][13][14]¬†Less frequently,¬†black people,[15]¬†Hispanics,[16]¬†and¬†Muslims[17]¬†are blamed, but merely as more fertile immigrants,[18]¬†invaders,[19]¬†or violent aggressors,[20]¬†rather than the masterminds of a secret plot.[21]

I don't hold the view that there is a conspiracy or secret cabal with such an agenda: 
>White genocide is a¬†myth,[22][23][15]¬†based on¬†pseudoscience,¬†pseudohistory, and¬†hatred,[24]¬†driven by a psychological panic often termed white extinction anxiety.[25][16]¬†There is no evidence that white people are dying out or facing extermination.[26][27][28][21]¬†The purpose of the conspiracy theory is to scare white people,[26]¬†and justify a commitment to a¬†white nationalist¬†agenda[29]¬†in support of increasingly successful calls to violence.[22][20][19]

I do hold that there is an element of truth in the premises of the theory and ironically it is a product of the mindset and ideology of white supremacy. White supremacists promote a purity doctrine of whiteness akin to the one-drop rule of colonial and Jim Crow USA.  They are and have historically been vocal about the supposed fragility/sanctity of the white essence easily overwhelmed by any interracial mixing. There's a significant element of confirmation bias operating in that the most easily visible products of intermixing are those persons whose nonwhite heritage is the differentiator. Mixed persons who passed as being of either ""pure"" heritage do not challenge ideals of purity and were socially encouraged to do so to ease negative consequences to themselves. The dominant perception becomes that products of intermixing favor non-white heritage which is a useful agitator among sympathetic people who spread the idea along relational networks. Purity doctrines rely on not compromising on identity lest their ideals be undermined so differences are highlighted. This might be a bit controversial but I believe that the ingroup-outgroup tension prompts outgroups to reinforce allegiances through common experience and references. So a mixed child of white and black heritage is ever more likely to be identified by others as black because lived experience and communal inclusion highlights one heritage over another. Under this paradigm, white heritage assimilates into nonwhite as white purity doctrine necessitates.

TLDR: White supremacists harping on about white purity means they reject mixed persons and encourage others to identify nonwhite heritage over white.

Edit: It appears I have having a disconnect in the use of the phrase ""complete nonsense"". This in my environment means a view or argument whose premises and conclusions in their entirety are wrong but it must be everything, nonsense and complete nonsense being distinct in scope. So in considering the premises of the white genocide/replacement theory, if the purity model of whiteness as a social construct is accepted/common culture then it's not complete nonsense. That's why I'm on CMV.",4/12/2021 23:30,,,,,,

\-Historical revisionism; downplaying the role of slavery as the motive behind the Civil War, argument that the Civil War was fought for ""Southern independence"".

\-On a fresh post from today, defense of preservation of CSA monuments as ""heritage"", dogwhistles  about Critical Race Theory, commenter implies ""white pride"" and refers to ""self-righteous hateful minorities"". Another commenter claims that the 1921 Tusla Massacre was in response to ""whites being raped"". Third selection needs no further elaboration:

>There were too many slaves to convert to wage labor and maintain profitability. And what would become of the slaves too young or too old to work **who up to now had been required by law to have welfare from the master**?

\-More decrying of recent removal of a Confederate monument as ""heritage"", along with comments again denying the role of slavery in the Civil War, as a war for Southern ""sovereignty"":

[https://archive.is/Cyex6](https://archive.is/Cyex6)

>**You have no idea what the civil war was about and have fell for deep propaganda** that somehow it was a battle of white supremacy even though white supremacy was extremely popular in both the North and South.  
>  
>**The war was solely over sovereignty**

\-More historical revisionism in this essay downplaying slavery as 'not that bad', claiming that ""slaves had rights"":

[https://archive.is/1pRx1](https://archive.is/1pRx1)

>A common myth is that slaves had no legal rights. This fabrication has more to do with the reality of Northern blacks than it does Southern slaves.

Thoughts?",ohsy7u,CapitalismVSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/ohsy7u/murray_rothbard_on_childrens_right_he_was_the/," Children's rights and parental obligations

n the Ethics of Liberty, Rothbard explores issues regarding children's rights in terms of self-ownership and contract.\[108\] These include support for a woman's right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children have the right to run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He argued that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a ""flourishing free market in children"". He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces‚Äîwhile ""superficially monstrous""‚Äîwill benefit ""everyone"" involved in the market: ""the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing"".\[109\]\[110\]In Rothbard's view of parenthood, ""the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights"".\[109\] Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right tolet any infant die by starvation and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, ""the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children"". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, ""the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum"".\[109\]Economist Gene Callahan of Cardiff University, formerly a scholar at the Rothbard-affiliated Mises Institute, observes that Rothbard allows ""the logical elegance of his legal theory"" to ""trump any arguments based on the moral reprehensibility of a parent idly watching her six-month-old child slowly starve to death in its crib",7/11/2021 2:04,,,,,,

People talking about champion mods on weapons being bad engaging in historical revisionism,pdykag,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/pdykag/people_talking_about_champion_mods_on_weapons/,"The problem with champion mods on weapons from day 1, was that it limited build options by preventing the use of any exotics besides heavy ones due to the need to slot a mod on anti champ weapons which exotics all lacked, they weren't an inherently bad idea, they simply had issues that limited build variety. 

This season, we are encountering a similar situation, with the only anti barrier being the fairly lackluster at range assault rifle option, and the majority of decent champ options taking 6 energy instead of 1, builds are being severely limited as a result of the system bungie has implemented.

There are solutions to this problem. Bungie can seperate champ mods and the other artifact mods into seperate categories. Making the anti champ mods inherently on all weapons by default by making them a passive on the artifact itself, while non champ mods on the artifact still need to be slotted in. This allows for build variety without punishing people for not having multiple mods and energy taken up by 100% neccesary mods that need to be run 100% of the time.

"An example of feminist historical revisionism: ""the rule of thumb"" as a legalized form of wife abuse never really existed and was instead fabricated by feminists",lw58ji,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/lw58ji/an_example_of_feminist_historical_revisionism_the/,"In the 1970s, feminists attempted to create a false etymology for the phrase *""rule of thumb""*.  It was claimed that husbands used to be able to beat their wives so long as they used a stick or a whip no thicker than their thumb.

This is of course not true, and the real etymology for the phrase comes from a practice of using the length or width of your thumb as a unit of measure.

You'd be surprised just how many people believe this to be true though.  The idea that men could legally beat their wives is a cornerstone of feminist dogma that they've tried to push for decades.  The evidence for this practice, however, is basically non-existent.  There are a couple court cases from the 1800s where men have seemingly gotten away with hitting their wives, but it has never actually been a legal practice under US law or under English common law.

And even those court cases that some feminists try to cite seem fairly lackluster. In one such case, the husband was found innocent due to a lack of bruising or marks on his wife.  Which feminists try to interpret as, ""it was fine so long as you didn't beat your wife too severely"".  Even if such a husband did get away with hitting his wife, clearly it was still a crime since it was prosecuted. And the reason he was found innocent came down to a lack of evidence, not because there was a misogynistic loophole that he took advantage of.  

Other court cases ruled on interpretations of English common law, which is taken to help legitimize the idea that some form of wife abuse used to be legal. However, those court rulings consistently found insufficient legal evidence to justify an exception, including for cases of ""mild discipline of your wife"".  Which if anything seems like evidence against this, not in favor of it.

Domestic violence wasn't explicitly outlawed in the US at a federal level until the early 1900s, which is another talking point you see about this. But it was still illegal at the state level going back to the 1600s. And would have also been illegal under regular assault laws. This is because there weren't any legal exceptions granted to husbands to assault their wives the way feminists like to say there were.

Even more damning is that wife abuse (but not husband abuse) carried with it very cruel and unusual punishments throughout most of history.  Under one law, a husband accused of beating his wife would be buried with just his head left above the ground so that his wife could do whatever she wanted to him in retribution.

In fact it was actually husband abuse, not wife abuse, that used to be legal in history.  Under some laws, a wife was not only allowed to beat her husband, but if she did, it was used as evidence that the husband had actually done something wrong and needed to be punished *even more*.  The assumption is that he had to have done something to piss her off bad enough to hit him.  And him making her mad, but not her hitting him out of anger, was deemed to be a crime.  Under some versions of this law, the punishment for making your wife angry enough to hit you included being drug throughout town by horses.

The expectation, both socially and legally, was that husbands were supposed to be subservient to their wives, not the other way around.

So not only is this feminist view lacking in evidence, but the very opposite of it seems to have been true.  

Here is a source I've been using for this for a while:

######The ""Great Taboo"" and the Role of Patriarchy in Husband and Wife Abuse

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf

Full text:

Not only does it go into the background of this controversy, the authors analyzed a bunch of papers that claim that wife abuse used to be legal to show that their citation trails basically go nowhere.  The only legitimate primary source is something written in the 1700s by Sir William Blackstone, an English judge. He claimed that someone told him that you could use moderate discipline on your wife at some distant point in the past, but even he couldn't find a reference to it in older law books. He then went on to say that such a thing would be obviously illegal in modern times (meaning in 1700s England).  Thus apparently refuting the claim in the very source that is commonly cited as evidence for it.  Modern historians have of course found no evidence for this, either.

Like a lot of things you come across in the context of gender and gender equality, I was expecting this to be fairly unknown outside of the men's community.  Obviously there are academic references but just because you have sources doesn't mean it's widely known about.

On a whim I decided to check out Wikipedia, just to see how this was handled there.  And I was surprised to find that not only was this mentioned as a myth, but the article itself went into a good bit of detail over the history of this revisionist claim.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb

Clearly there's been a bit of ""debate"" that's played out on this page, given the length of discussion that's afforded to this just in the intro section (where it goes back and forth with a few feminist talking points sprinkled in here or there). But ultimately the facts have prevailed.

What I found interesting is just how much time, energy, and money feminists have put into making this seem like a legitimate fact.  To quote Wikipedia,

>In the 20th century, public concern with the problem of domestic violence declined at first, and then re-emerged along with the resurgent feminist movement in the 1970s.[3] The first recorded link between wife-beating and the phrase *rule of thumb* appeared in 1976, in a report on domestic violence by women's-rights advocate Del Martin:

>>For instance, the common-law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband 'the right to whip his wife, provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb'‚Äîa rule of thumb, so to speak.[5]

>While Martin appears to have meant the phrase *rule of thumb* only as a figure of speech, some feminist writers treated it as a literal reference to an earlier law.[5][19] The following year, a book on battered women stated:

>>One of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the 'rule of thumb'. Included in the British Common Law was a section regulating wifebeating [...] The new law stipulated that the reasonable instrument be only 'a rod not thicker than his thumb.' In other words, wifebeating was legal.[20]

>Despite this erroneous reading of the common law (which is a set of judicial principles rather than a written law with individual sections) the spurious legal doctrine of the ""rule of thumb"" was soon mentioned in a number of law journals.[3][7] The myth was repeated in a 1982 report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights on domestic abuse titled ""Under the Rule of Thumb"", as well as a later United States Senate report on the Violence Against Women Act.[3]

>In the late 20th century, some efforts were made to discourage the phrase *rule of thumb*,[7] which was seen as taboo owing to this false origin.[3] Patricia T. O'Conner, former editor of the *New York Times* Book Review, described it as ""one of the most persistent myths of political correctness"".[5] During the 1990s, several authors wrote about the false etymology of *rule of thumb*, including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers,[3] who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone's commentary.[12] Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.[3]

There are other myths floating around out there as well.  For example it is often said that you could beat your wife on certain days of the week or in certain locations (commonly the courthouse steps on Sunday).

Despite being widely repeated and endorsed by feminists, as near as I can tell, that one is a myth also:

https://www.thisismysouth.com/11-unusual-outdated-southern-laws/

So why make these efforts to rewrite history?

And what does it say about your ideology that you have to make things up to help legitimatize it?

This isn't the only area that feminists have engaged in historical revisionism.  Other examples include the nature of coverture under English common law (a type of marriage), the treatment of women as literal slaves to men, and of course the history of the movement itself.  ""First wave feminism"" and ""second wave feminism"" weren't actually older incarcerations of feminism. Most of those people didn't call themselves feminists and they definitely wouldn't have agreed with modern feminist ideology. Despite this, a great deal of time and effort has been made to appropriate their accomplishments under the banner of feminism.

The good news is that a lot more attention has been given to this recently.  Sources are easier to come by and there have even been a couple books written by impartial historians about this (including at least one book, *The Privileged Sex*, where the author went in to it under the assumption that women were oppressed, and was surprised to find just how incorrect of a view that is).

Facts can't be hidden forever.  You can try to rewrite history all you want, but people are going to find the truth when they go looking for it.",3/2/2021 17:56,,,,,,

Lapu-Lapu and Historical Revisionism,n5vqo6,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/n5vqo6/lapulapu_and_historical_revisionism/,"Strong attacks with political purposes are being alleged due to Bong Go's comments on Lapu-Lapu.  The story of the Muslims from the south that Lapu-Lapu was from them is not a new one and is prevalent enough that Bisayans in the south have accepted it.

The historians that have tried to force the narrative that he was a Cebuano have also told some tales.  For instance Rappler's fact checker on the matter says this, ""The only existing historical document on Lapulapu says he was a chieftan from Mactan.""  


The historical document referred to is Pigafetta's account.  If you read the account it says that Zula, a principle man or chief of the island of Matan approached Magellan's men for help.  Lapu-Lapu is only called a rival chief and there is no mention of where he is from.

Pigafetta's account also reports that the chiefs in the Bisayas could communicate with Magellan's Moro slave who was from Moluccas.  This slave was also the one sent to communicate with Lapu-Lapu.  He had never been to the archipelago before.  They must have been speaking a Malay language from the south.  


Finally, in order to continue to denounce a historical narrative that doesn't back their nationalism, they must reject the testimony of the Aginid that Lapu-Lapu was an ""orang laut"" and returned to Brunei after the killing of Magellan.  The Aginid is a Cebuano/Bisayan record and does not originate from the Southern Philippines.  It also has quite a few aspects that testify to it pre-dating Spanish influence in the region.",5/6/2021 4:15,,,,,,

In particular it comes with an unsupported claim saying:

>""However, it is a historical fact that the first attack by Austria-Hungary (backed by Germany) on Serbia (backed by Russia) happened in the 27th of July 1914 and not July 28""

This INC response follows the narrative of: ""since violence occurred then it is fair to say the war started on 27th."" **However it is NOT a historical fact that the first attack by Austria-Hungary occurred on July 27th.** In fact, no violence occurred on that date.

The first noted attack was documented immediately *after* the declaration of war on July 28th. Between the evening of July 28 and morning of the 29th, Austria-Hungary commenced their first attack by firing artillery shells on the Serbian capital of Belgrade. (Source: Gordon Martel, The Origins of the First World War, Pearson Longman, Harlow, 2003, p. xii f.)

In August 11-12th, Austria-Hungary then launched their first coordinated offensive campaign (out of three) against Serbia, resulting in the Battle of Cer. (Source: [http://www.serbia.com/about-serbia/serbia-history/world-war-one/the-battle-of-cer/](http://www.serbia.com/about-serbia/serbia-history/world-war-one/the-battle-of-cer/))

This evidence is counter to INC and JV's claims that the first violence occurred on the 27th. The linked picture is once again proof of the Iglesia ni Cristo's habit of revising historical facts (with no proof) to fit their narrative that INC was established on the exact same date as WWI beginning.

Why do I post so much about WWI? First off, I'm a corporate lawyer and I make a living off of useless semantic arguments. Second off, I went to a U.S. university with one of the top European history departments - I spent one year researching 20th century European history including the Great War.

Historical Revisionism and the Civil Rights Movement,m5pl93,IntellectualDarkWeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntellectualDarkWeb/comments/m5pl93/historical_revisionism_and_the_civil_rights/,"A few weeks ago my little brother brought home his AP U.S History textbook. (For those of you who don‚Äôt know, AP is a sort of college class taught in high school.) Curious, I decided to flip through it a little. 

What surprised me most was the historical revisionism with which the civil rights movement was treated. MLK is portrayed as a simple Christian man who ‚Äúhad a dream‚Äù with all references to his socialism and anti-imperialism scrubbed. Rosa Parks, in this telling, is just an ordinary woman and her ties to the American communist movement are conveniently omitted. Malcolm X is not even referenced. Overall, civil rights heroes are treated as apolitical figures aside from their stand for racial equality

So why is this history scrubbed? We often hear that if we can‚Äôt learn our history, we are doomed to repeat it, but it seems everyone is content to bury the socialist politics of our country‚Äôs civil rights leaders. Surely, indoctrinating our high schoolers with caricatures of our civil rights leaders is unhealthy for society. I‚Äôm sure it makes republicans feel good that they can weakly try to claim some lineage to the civil rights movement (given say MLK‚Äôs Christianity) and helps make the civil rights movement more palatable to white audiences, but clearly we shouldn‚Äôt put the feelings of politicians or readers ahead of the history of itself. I worry this telling of history also perpetuates the myth that we can‚Äôt care about economic issues and racial equality at the same time 

So why isn‚Äôt there more outrage about the history being taught to our children? I hear so much whining about the fact that US history courses focus so much on slavery and the genocide of native Americans (that is, half of our nation‚Äôs history), but I never hear anyone discuss how civil rights leaders are so horribly misrepresented.

"An example of feminist historical revisionism: ""the rule of thumb"" as a legalized form of wife abuse",lunskk,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/lunskk/an_example_of_feminist_historical_revisionism_the/,"In the 1970s, feminists attempted to create a false etymology for the phrase *""rule of thumb""*.  It was claimed that husbands used to be able to beat their wives so long as they used a stick or a whip no thicker than their thumb.

This is of course not true, and the real etymology for the phrase comes from a practice of using the length or width of your thumb as a unit of measure.

You'd be surprised just how many people believe this to be true though.  The idea that men could legally beat their wives is a cornerstone of feminist dogma that they've tried to push for decades.  The evidence for this practice, however, is basically non-existent.  There are a couple court cases from the 1800s where men have seemingly gotten away with hitting their wives, but it has never actually been a legal practice under US law or under English common law.

And even those court cases that some feminists try to cite seem fairly lackluster. In one such case, the husband was found innocent due to a lack of bruising or marks on his wife.  Which feminists try to interpret as, ""it was fine so long as you didn't beat your wife too severely"".  Even if such a husband did get away with hitting his wife, clearly it was still a crime since it was prosecuted. And the reason he was found innocent came down to a lack of evidence, not because there was a misogynistic loophole that he took advantage of.  

Other court cases ruled on interpretations of English common law, which is taken to help legitimize the idea that some form of wife abuse used to be legal. However, those court rulings consistently found insufficient legal evidence to justify an exception, including for cases of ""mild discipline of your wife"".  Which if anything seems like evidence against this, not in favor of it.

Domestic violence wasn't explicitly outlawed in the US at a federal level until the early 1900s, which is another talking point you see about this. But it was still illegal at the state level going back to the 1600s. And would have also been illegal under regular assault laws. This is because there weren't any legal exceptions granted to husbands to assault their wives the way feminists like to say there were.

Even more damning is that wife abuse (but not husband abuse) carried with it very cruel and unusual punishments throughout most of history.  Under one law, a husband accused of beating his wife would be buried with just his head left above the ground so that his wife could do whatever she wanted to him in retribution.

In fact it was actually husband abuse, not wife abuse, that used to be legal in history.  Under some laws, a wife was not only allowed to beat her husband, but if she did, it was used as evidence that the husband had actually done something wrong and needed to be punished *even more*.  The assumption is that he had to have done something to piss her off bad enough to hit him.  And him making her mad, but not her hitting him out of anger, was deemed to be a crime.  Under some versions of this law, the punishment for making your wife angry enough to hit you included being drug throughout town by horses.

The expectation, both socially and legally, was that husbands were supposed to be subservient to their wives, not the other way around.

So not only is this feminist view lacking in evidence, but the very opposite of it seems to have been true.  

Here is a source I've been using for this for a while:

O'Conner, former editor of the *New York Times* Book Review, described it as ""one of the most persistent myths of political correctness"".[5] During the 1990s, several authors wrote about the false etymology of *rule of thumb*, including the conservative social critic Christina Hoff Sommers,[3] who described its origin in a misunderstanding of Blackstone's commentary.[12] Nonetheless, the myth persisted in some legal sources into the early 2000s.[3]

There are other myths floating around out there as well.  For example it is often said that you could beat your wife on certain days of the week or in certain locations (commonly the courthouse steps on Sunday).

Despite being widely repeated and endorsed by feminists, as near as I can tell, that one is a myth also:

So why make these efforts to rewrite history?

And what does it say about your ideology that you have to make things up to help legitimatize it?

This isn't the only area that feminists have engaged in historical revisionism.  Other examples include the nature of coverture under English common law (a type of marriage), the treatment of women as literal slaves to men, and of course the history of the movement itself.  ""First wave feminism"" and ""second wave feminism"" weren't actually older incarcerations of feminism. Most of those people didn't call themselves feminists and they definitely wouldn't have agreed with modern feminist ideology. However a great deal of time and effort has been made to appropriate their accomplishments under the banner of feminism.

The good news is that a lot more attention has been given to this recently.  Sources are easier to come by and there have even been a couple books written by impartial historians about this (including at least one book, *The Privileged Sex*, where the author went in to it under the assumption that women were oppressed, and was surprised to find just how incorrect of a view that is).

Facts can't be hidden forever.  You can try to rewrite history all you want, but people are going to find the truth when they actually go looking for it.",2/28/2021 21:11,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION

Among the many claims that revisionists raise against Stalin, there is one recurrent idea: that Stalin somehow helped Hitler, actively or passively, before the Second World War. 

In order to refute this claim, we have to produce a well sourced demonstration, and to produce it consensually and logically as possible, while trying to respect the more possible the raw material which will consist in consensual historical sources & links, aka mostly Wikipedia for the libs to don't be too much shaked.

What needs to be examinated here is the context and the events that led to war, and especially the relationships between Germany, the Soviet Union and the two imperialist powers of Europe ‚Äì France and the United Kingdom. The best representatives of Soviet international policy would be the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Viacheslav Molotov, ambassadors to capitalist countries like [Maxim Litvinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov), and more specifically, the diplomats that Litvinov himself deployed, like Ivan Maisky, who was one of the key figures of the diplomatic corps of the USSR in 1930s Europe, and Litvinov‚Äôs close friend.

‚Ä¢ [Maisky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Maisky) was a historian, a diplomat and a statesman in the Soviet Union. He served as Ambassador to Finland, and was later deployed to London in 1932. He was the author of the proposed policy known as collective security, which consisted of an alliance between UK, France and USSR against Hitler as early as 1934.
So how did France and the UK respond to his collective security proposal and what was their relationship with Nazi Germany?

FRENCH SITUATION IN THE 30s AND HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HITLER.

In 1934, France underwent a fascist coup d'√©tat attempt, known as [La crise du 6 f√©vrier 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_February_1934_crisis), during which far right extremists attempted a violent takeover of the Deputy Chamber, leading to the resignation of[Prime Minister Edouard Daladier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Daladier). This event set the stage for the French response to Soviet attempts at anti-fascism.

Some may have expected that after the coup attempt plus the Spanish civil war, in the context of the rise of Nazism and Fascism, a few years later, the rise of the [Popular Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(France)) with the ""socialist"" Leon Blum leading the country would signify a larger cooperation of liberals and socialists aimed at countering the growth of fascism as exemplified by Litvinov‚Äôs and Maisky‚Äôs proposal. Blum, however preferred to ally the liberals rather than give an inch to the communists. Instead of cooperating with the Soviet Union against fascism, Blum‚Äôs government signed a [non intervention pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-intervention_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War#Non-Intervention_Committee) with the fascists leaders, giving them an excuse for letting down their republican ""allies"" in the Spanish Civil War. This sent a clear message to Mussolini, Hitler and Franco that they were free to cooperate to crush their respective opponents and disregard any treaty signed with Western governments, foreshadowing what would later happen after the Munich Agreement...

Another example of the collaboration between France and Germany was after the return of Dalladier  after the fall of the Popular Front. In January 1939, eight months before the war, Daladier decided to create the [infamous concentration campc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_camps_in_France#Spanish_Civil_War) in southern France to intern hundreds of thousands of Spanish refugees, forbidding them to provide support of any kind to their brethren back in Spain.

One may argue that the French bourgeoisie had to choose between Communism, in the trail of 1936's revolution, and Nazism with its Nazi neighboor, and that they clearly choosed to side with the Nazi. In fact, it was an historiographical thesis that was popular in the 40's, called [the Synarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synarchism#In_Vichy_France). It was initially an analysis from P√©tain's government, that a numbers of banksters and other industrial figure were actually collaborating with the USA and UK to fight P√©tain government. At the lib√©ration, many communist figures developed more this thesis, arguing that it was in fact a collusion between FR/UK rulling class and Germany's one. This particular thesis is being developed again by one, if not the best french marxist historian actually alive, [Annie Lacroix-riz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Lacroix-Riz), and is very interesting. 

There are numerous element showing this is a reality, one of them being [a book wrote by De Gaulle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vers_l%27arm%C3%A9e_de_m%C3%A9tier) himself, the french G√©n√©ral, who published a book (there's no english version of this article, sorry for that) that criticized the French army and precognized a reform and the mass production of Tank, as well as a reinforcement of the North Est front, right where Hitler will send all his troops year later, which is no coincidence, Hitler even ironically said thanks to de Gaulle for this analysis. Yet no one in the French army listened to de Gaulle, worst, Blum criticized him for wanting to make a coup, and the whole head of the army almost laugh at him.
I could have speak about [Louis Renault who was a friend of Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Renault_(industrialist)#World_War_I,_interwar_period_and_developments). He met him the 21th february 1935 in the Reich Chancelry, pleading for an industrial agreement between the two countries. In 1936, his workers in his two factories in Paris where amongst the most advanced bastion of the popular front strikers, and were considered champions. After the liberation in 44, he was accused of active collaboration with the ennemy, and died one month later in prison without being judged. Three month after his death, Renault was nationalized, and was a great tool for the French state economy.

We've seen Blum signing a non intervention pact with Hitler in 36; the Synarchy historiographical thesis; De Gaulle's book rejectal; and Louis Renault collaboration and support to Hitler. There are much more to say, like the infamous Munich Pact for instance, but let's move forward or else the post will be a book. Now come to the UK situation.

UK RULING CLASS' COLLUSION

We've fastly seen the situation of France in the 30's and how its political elite made the choice of collaborating with Hitler and Mussolini early in the 30s, how they betrayed the Spanish revolutionaries, so, now, what about the UK and its situation in the 30s in regards of the same Collective security proposal? How the political world and the diplomatic field were between UK and Germany for instance ?

Here is a quick list of fact in regards of the collaboration between UK political elite and Nazi Germany during the 30s.

In 1935, the Britains unilateraly decided to overthrow the [Versaille treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles#Military_restrictions) that forbid Germany to have a navy, and signed an agreement with the nazi germany that allowed them to have 35% of the total tonnage of the Royal Navy on a permanent basis, the [Anglo-German naval agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement). And it's only one side of the collusion between the uk elits and the german one. 

The Duke of Windsor, formerly King of the united kingdom, was a firm supporter of Adolf Hitler, in fact, [he met him at his very private house of Berghof, in Bavaria, in october 37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII#Second_World_War). He even give openly full nazi salute at his time. Fortunately for him, he had to resign before his great allies, the Nazi, declared the war to his own kingdom. It may have helped in his decision to abdicate, officially because he couldn't marry the wife he wanted, but the truth is that it would have been a national treator and a burden for the crown during the incoming wartime, and it was better to prevent this embarassing situation.

Or even other members of Artistocracy, like the famous [Unity Mitford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Mitford#Arrival_in_Germany) and her sister, [Diana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Mitford), who were one a firm nazi and the other one a fascist supporter. In fact Diana is the wife of the UK Fascist party leader. Unity met Hitler in 34 for the first time, and in 38 she was even at his side when he announced the Anschluss. Hitler even had a obsessive phase about Unity, as he thought she was a perfect exemple of Aryanism, blonde, aristocratic blood, racist etc... She literally spent her summer in the Berghof. When the war began, Hitler send her back to the UK, for obvious reason. In despair, she shoot herself one bullet in the head. She survived, and Hitler went to check her condition in hospital before definitely sending her out of Germany.

It's worth mentioning that one of their cousine is the wife of Winston Churchill, Cl√©mentine Hozier, by the way.
Another important but unknown figure of this era is [St√©phanie Von Hohenlohe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_von_Hohenlohe), a swedish aristocrat that was a close friend of Hitler. She's jewish and yet had really close ties with Ribbentrop, Himmler and G√∂ring. According to a MI6 report from  1938 that shows that the English Crown knew about her connexion, ""The f√ºhrer oftenly speak about her. He appreciate her good advices and her intelligence. She's maybe the only woman able to influence Hitler.""

She went to live in London in 1932, and as she was a high aristocrats thanks to her wedding, she infiltrated easily the most highest aristocrats circle in the UK. She was a close friend of Lord Rothermere for instance, the owner of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, two pro nazi newspaper that were advocating for an alliance with Nazi Germany. 
Another role she had was to transmit secrete message from UK known figures to Hitler. She organized a meeting between Lord Halifax and G√∂ring in 1937, and also the meeting with the Duc of Windsor we spoke about earlier.
When the war began, she flee to the USA where she spent the rest of her life living peacefully. She also succesfully re-establish contact in post war Germany, with many influent figure such as Henri Nannen or Axel Springer.

We've seen how the UK broke Versaille's Treaty unilaterally, the numerous ties between its aristocracy and Nazi's Germany, thru the Mitford's daughters, the Duc of Windsor or Von Hohenlohe, despite the fact that the later was a known Hitler's friend. Let's come back to the international situation.

THE EUROPEAN SCENE AND ITS DEVELOPMENT

In March 1938, Hitler launch what is known as the [Anschluss or Anschlu√ü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss), a coup d'√©tat to dissolve Austria into Germany, with little to no reaction from Dalladier (who came back after Blum) & Chamberlain.

This inaction from the west reinforced Hiter in his conquest policy, and later, the 30 September 1938, the [Munich Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) is a direct consequences to the inaction, to be polite, of the west. Munich Pact legalized the Czechoslovakia invasion as well as the Sudenten crisis. It was an agreement made only between UK, France, Italy and Germany.

USSR tried to defend Czechoslovakia, as [this article from the famous Le Monde Diplomatique highlight](https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2018/10/GORODETSKY/59133), but unfortunately for the czechoslovak, the treaty that tied USSR and Czechoslovakia included one specific condition: that France, who was tied by another treaty with Czechoslovakia btw, intervene too. And guess who refused to intervene, leading to a de facto sabotage of the USSR help ? That's right, once again, it's France. To resume it correctly, USSR, France and Czechoslovakia had an agreement in case of a German invasion, this agreement had one particular condition, pushed at the time by the Czechoslovakia presidency, and this condition was that for USSR troops to come in, there must be another French contingent. And guess who betrayed this treaty and signed with Germany, de facto helping Germany in invading Czechoslovakia, by refusing to send their troops ? France.


So now, after all this shitshow from UK & France, signing multiple pact with Hitler, refusing to sign some with USSR, not respecting already sign international treaty, seeing the collusion between UK/FR ruling class and German one, and while Litvinov & Maisky keep defending the collective security the whole time, how can one blame the USSR for finally make a pact with Hitler themselves too ? Especially since it's this pact that allow USSR to win time to produce more war commodity, at a point when it was clear that Hitler will invade the east and the west.

There is no such thing as, ""Stalin gave the permission to Hitler to do the war with his pact"", or even ""UK & France were playing the appeasement"".

West Political elite made the deliberate choice of the defeat. The UK aristocracy had strong ties with Nazi Germany, and they factually broke their own comitment in the Treaty of Versaille to give to the Nazi their fleet in an unprecedented technological transfert. The French high bourgeoisie made the choice of the defeat, and were in favor of an annexion of part of France that were heavily under PCF hands (The industrialized north).

Saying otherwise is plain revisionism, and we have plenty of material to prove it. I could have speak about the [IG Farben international stock market capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IG_Farben#Foundation) that de facto gave a way to international capitalist to finance the Nazi, and more globally the chemical Cartel that will later on provide the """"""best solution"""""" for the final solution, aka use of mass chemical gases in death chambers, or about the [Remilitarization of the Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland), or about the [1935 Saar status referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1935_Saar_status_referendum) which were all possibility for the international community to reprehend Hitler rising, all """"""missed"""""". But I think I've covered enough for one time, and with all those link, there is plenty of reading about the subject.

Except for 1 link, that is an article of the well known and respected Le Monde Diplomatique, all the link are wikipedia, all consulted the 26/06/2019.

Also I want to stress out how much this article from Le Monde Diplomatique is important, and I really hope that some french comrade that is better than me at translating can translate it, because it's an important article in regards of the 30s diplomatic era.

They declared war on Germany for attacking Poland but didn't send troops but were ready to send troops to Finland... Finland was asked to give the area around Leningrad and in turn the USSR would give them an area 2x the size but they refused on Hitler's proposal.

also this

In March 1939, the Soviet Union began negotiations to form an anti-fascist alliance. Great Britain and France allowed time to pass, maneuvered. By this attitude, the two great ""democracies"" made Hitler understand that he could march against Stalin without being worried about the West. From June to August 1939, secret British-German talks took place: in exchange for guaranteeing the integrity of the British Empire, the British would allow Hitler to act freely in the East. On July 29, Charles Roden Buxton of the Labour Party fulfilled a secret mission for Prime Minister Chamberlain to the German Embassy. The following plan was elaborated:


""Great Britain would express her willingness to conclude an agreement with Germany for a delimitation of spheres of interest ....


Germany promises not to interfere in British Empire affairs.


2) Great Britain promises fully to respect the German spheres of interest in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. A consequence of this would be that Great Britain would renounce the guarantees she gave to certain States in the German sphere of interest. Great Britain further promises to influence France to break up her alliance with the Soviet union and to give up her ties in Southeastern Europe.


3) Great Britain promises to give up the present negotiations for a pact with the Soviet Union.""",9/14/2020 19:35,,,,,,

I recall, Carl. B Boyer confirming in his book ""History of Mathematics"" the vast work by muslim scientists in the Islamic Golden Age. Nevertheless, I'm not a historian by profession & willing to learn. Is there any truth to it or nonsensical historical revisionism?

About [the little book *On the Jews and their Lies* (1543) | wkpd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies)  
> Luther expresses an anti-Judaic rather than a racist anti-semitic view.[13] (But he did express the Judes as an arrogant tribe, with their excuse for superiority being descent from the Israelites of Bible fame. The Judaic writers of the wikipedia article are falsely claiming not a race, as usual.)

Of course, [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) lived long before ideas of inherited traits and behaviors were established. In Luther's day, inheritance was all about place in society. Being a monk, he probably had limited knowledge of Judaic racial traits, and news/history was less detailed then too. Medieval times were called ""Dark Ages"" for valid reasons. [Medieval Latin Literature | brtnca](https://www.britannica.com/art/Latin-literature/Medieval-Latin-literature)

[Development of the Idea of Race: Classical Paradigms and Medieval Elaborations; review essay by (((David M. Goldenberg )))](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dmg2/hannaford%20_with%20additions_%20for%20web.pdf) (of course, the Judes are always concerned about being accused a separate race, except when it suits their intensely racist [inner-party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Party) paradigm)


Before we begin, some irony; Martin Luther detested Jude's mendacity, yet accepted their sacred texts as significant in his own life. Luther lived near the advent of popular education via [Gutenberg's press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press). He was one of the pioneers of the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#Religion), as he touted popular use of the [vernacular book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Bible) he wrote to replace the corrupt, arcane (Latin), repressive, Catholic Church, for which Biblical texts were of priestly use, the populations were mostly illiterate.

[pre-Lutheran versions of Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate)

Today's Holy Bible is a result of centuries of revisions of old texts. In those earlier times, religion was a [conflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflation) of politics, and nationalism (cultural heritage). Your reviewer considers a minor tragedy that human nature tends to deny out-group, or foreign themes for domestic (ingroup) consumption (via censure, re-writing to conform), which has corrupted our historical heritage. The European Renaissance was exceptional in its apparent revival of ancient literature, some in its original forms, and some as transmitted in Arabic from contemporary-to-original sources.

S√∂hne von Deutschland gegen Juden

In regard of accepting the texts, we must admit that [Adolf Hitler](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/political-leaders-of-world-war-two/adolf-hitler/) who also infamously hated Jews, was more honest in so far as Jewish-text-skepticism is concerned. Hitler [regarded as sacred](https://creation.com/review-hitlers-religion-weikart), not the Christians (ideological descendants of Jews) but the [north European heritage of Scandinavia](http://www.viking.ucla.edu/volsungs/wagner.html), (especially as depicted in the [Wagnerian epics](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/8659814/Hitler-and-Wagner.html)), the [racial heritage of white people (Indo-Europeans)](https://www.amren.com/news/2017/11/white-race-aryan-people-indo-europeans-sam-francis/) and perhaps some other obscure muckery, like [F Nietzsche](https://www.quora.com/What-impact-did-Nietzsche-have-on-the-personal-philosophy-of-Adolf-Hitler-and-the-Third-Reich), or ([Occultism](https://aeon.co/ideas/the-nazis-as-occult-masters-its-a-good-story-but-not-history)) tossed into the salad that was to be the (brief) Third Reich.

*Chaque pays se croit meilleure que ses voisins et chaque nation est juste.* (Every country thinks itself better than its neighbors, and every nation is right.)

Adolf Hitler understood these contrasts of ethos between Jews and his own ""Aryans"". His answer to German survival was segregation, and in that much, [he was right.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlternativeHypothesis/comments/but1el/moron_world_war_is_not_a_wise_goal_lessons_from/?) But our memory of Hitler has been tarred and feathered by Judaic propaganda since 1945, pervasively in western culture.

[White People by and large may be doomed by demographic replacement](https://www.amren.com/features/2015/06/the-cult-of-white-extinction-and-how-to-reverse-it/), but there will be pockets, islands, havens, of them who are not so tolerant and willing to follow the road to extinction. Taylor's essay (prev. link) highlights some traits which are evolutionary weaknesses in a multi-ethnic environment. But who is behind the apparently successful process of exploiting white people's racial traits to their own advantage? Luther had some answers to that, the infamous Juice Question.

background: arrogance associated with sinfulness by tradition

Christian doctrine says [Original Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin) taints everyone, so be a good Christian and accept your meekness and humility before our God.  
Sin is a key element of Christian theology, but arrogance [(pride)](http://www.deadlysins.com/pride/) is apparently a denial of sin, ergo blasphemy (another sin) in disguise.

Jesus' meekness and 'love thy neighbor' doctrines are explained by Reza Aslan (*Zealot*) as a post-Jesus cover-up of Jesus actual animosity toward powers-that-be during his lifetime. The post-Jesus sales pitch (Saul/Paul et al.) to Jesus' enemies (Romans) needed to downplay the essentially seditious intentions concealed in his revolutionary teachings. [Jesuit review of *Zealot*](https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/culture/messiah-complex)  
> Jesus advocated overthrow and destruction‚Äî violent if need be‚Äî of the ruling powers and their replacement by a kingdom that favored the poor and oppressed.

R Aslan's theme is an elaboration of Jay Haley's *Power Tactics of Jesus Christ* 1969; title ""zealot"" is lifted directly out of Haley's text.

Notice these modern arguments are in favor of works *of the faithful believer*. This is obfuscation, because these are modern ministers trying to justify works (eg. tithe) to justify their own existence. Luther aimed his disavowal of works *of the Church*, IOW, ministrations required of clergy (not works of the faithful (eg. helping others, direct charity). Luther's ""faith alone"" aim was for Christians to be rid of the (Roman) Church.

They say we can't blame illegal migrant young adults for the actions of their parents, which was the action of human trafficking. 

They're destroying statues like iconoclasts. 

""

The Arcata, California city council voted Wednesday night to remove the statue of President William McKinley from the town square. The statue has been in place for over a hundred years. As per usual, McKinley's sins have not been clearly elucidated. He was assassinated in 1901. Like Matt Lauer, the statue will vanish into the ether. One of the groups demanding the statue's removal is the Humboldt State University student group, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanco de Aztlan, whatever that means. I'm embarrassed to admit I'm a resident of Arcata. Our neighboring town to the north is McKinleyville. The town's name is probably not long for this world.
